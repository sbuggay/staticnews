You can use these highly energetic photons to kill off cancer cells. The difficulty really is ... killing the cancer cells without killing the patient - but the problem with using x-rays is that you can&#x27;t shoot them at tumors inside the body without also burning some of the tissue on the way to the tumor and behind it... But you can use beams of other particles instead and this is where particle physics enters ... A beam of protons is far less likely to interact with tissue on short distances</i><p>And it is still part of the &quot;kinder&quot; set (protons are &quot;kinder&quot; than x-rays).<p><i>New Cancer Treatment With Proton Flashes Goes on Trial</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=K515uMQQzV4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=K515uMQQzV4</a></div><br/><div id="39046244" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39046244" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bearjaws</span><span>|</span><a href="#39046052">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39046745">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39046244">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39046244">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I actually worked with MGH on their first proton treatment software for non cyberknife proton treatment. Later scaled it into AWS so their dosimetrists could iterate on treatment plans much faster. The initial treatments were incredibly successful and much easier on the patient, but theres no miracle either.<p>Patients still suffer adverse reactions, and you will have margins of error, not to mention you do not have unlimited time to develop a treatment plan that is perfect. It&#x27;s a time&#x2F;efficacy trade off and the goal is to hit as much of the cancer as possible, while maintaining a SAFE dose of radiation, not a zero dose. What is a safe dose? Well, the more aggressive your cancer the higher that number gets too.<p>Some patients still receive high dose radiation while on proton treatment simply because their cancer is that aggressive, typically suffering the same grade 1-2 diarrhea and vomiting as any other form of radiation.<p>Proton treatment is far superior for most cancers, especially deeper cancers like colon and prostate.<p>It&#x27;s a living example of how tragic a new treatment option is, unfortunately proton centers are expensive to build and take years.

That said, theyre limited because cancer can evolve to defeat the immune response, and occasionally the immune system either under or over-reacts.<p>Also if you think there’s no sense of urgency, you haven’t talked to anyone actually in the field.

It literally saved my life. However, the risks of blinatumomab were seen as much riskier than chemotherapy. Most notably, blinatumomab has a significant risk of triggering a cytokine storm[0], a frequently-fatal immune reaction cascade. When starting a cycle of blinatumomab, the hospital required that I be inpatient for 7 days and they checked my vitals at least once every two hours. (This was _miserable_ for my sleep schedule, which is already a mess when in the hospital.) My regimen was 7 days in the hospital, then 21 days at home constantly connected to the pump, then 7 days of recovery time before starting another cycle.<p>At the time I took blinatumomab, I had already had unsuccessful treatments with two different chemo regimens. At the hospital system I was at, at least one failed chemo regimen was a pre-requisite for blinatumomab, as it was only indicated for &quot;refractory&quot; or &quot;recurrent&quot; cancers. I assume this is more related to the chance of acute death and (at the time) relative newness of blinatumomab compared to established chemotherapy regimens. (B-cell ALL is sadly very common in children, but this fortunately means that there is a LOT of funding research into the disease.)<p>After going through 3 one-month cycles of blinatumomab, it was becoming less effective, but I was able to line up a allogenic stem cell transplant which has (knock on a thousand woods) kept me clean for the 8 years since.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cytokine_storm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cytokine_storm</a></div><br/><div id="39048747" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39048747" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pama</span><span>|</span><a href="#39045837">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39046763">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39045944">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39048747">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39048747">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Amazing story.

So instead they charge $200k to get the most from the patients they <i>can</i> capture like the X% of patients who are allergic to the chemo drugs and have no choice (Just an example, I don&#x27;t know the specifics for blinatumomab)</div><br/></div></div><div id="39046560" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39046560" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">seventytwo</span><span>|</span><a href="#39045837">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39046479">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39046758">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39050512">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39046560">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39046560">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The research, development, approval process, and production all absolutely cost money that needs to be recouped from the sale, but we shouldn’t ever forget the <i>reason</i> why the company exists: to make profit.</div><br/><div id="39047623" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39047623" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">konschubert</span><span>|</span><a href="#39045837">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39046560">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39046734">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39047623">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39047623">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You also need to pay for all the other research projects that did NOT yield a successful drug.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39046734" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39046734" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wahnfrieden</span><span>|</span><a href="#39045837">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39046560">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39047623">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39050512">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39046734">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39046734">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In other words, no it is not only supply and demand - it’s the desire to maximize profit as far as the market will bear</div><br/><div id="39046797" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39046797" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">daedrdev</span><span>|</span><a href="#39045837">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39046734">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39050512">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39046797">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39046797">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Or like the other response to your parent comment said, it could cost a ton to make, which lowers the number of people who can get it, driving costs even higher due to low volume.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39050512" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39050512" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">1letterunixname</span><span>|</span><a href="#39045837">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39048888">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39050512">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39050512">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m interested in studies that address the 800 lbs. gorilla in the room: widespread over-nutrition with the post-WW2 &quot;Western diet&quot; is likely the primary suspected cause of a subset of cancers not seen in holdout individuals adhering to traditional diets and portion sizes that avoid too many calories and processed foods.
