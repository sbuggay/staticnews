====================<p>Avi  A workalike version of the UNIX vi editor for the
  amiga. Though not especially recommended for beginners,
  designed for those of you who may have the vi commands
  permanently hard-coded into your fingertips! Version
  1.0, binary only. Author: Peter Nestor<p>CLI_Utilities This directory contains several subdirectories with
  small utilities, collected from various sources, that
  are only usable from the CLI. See the Readme file for
  further information. Some include source. Author:
  Various<p>Dark  A small graphics and animation demo. Includes source.
  Author: Phil Robertson<p>Flow2Troff A little utility to convert from New Horizons Software
  &quot;FLOW&quot; files to UNIX &quot;troff&quot; files, suitable for
  printing on any troff-compatible laser printer. Version
  1.0, includes source and a sample &quot;FLOW&quot; file. Author:
  Daniel Barrett<p>LabyrinthII A shareware role-playing text adventure game similar in
  operation to the Infocom text adventures. Includes

  FORM, CAT and LIST files in a manner that complies with
  the IFF CAT specification. Version 1.2, includes
  source. Author: Karl Lehenbauer<p>SetPALorNTSC A couple of utility programs for testing the
  suitability of a developed program in either the PAL or
  NTSC environments. Includes source and a sample
  program. Author: Peter Kittel<p>TES  &quot;The Electronic Slave&quot; adds a gadget strip to the top
  of the cli window to perform such functions as device
  directories, info, run ED, and time. Currently,
  assignments are hardcoded but not difficult to change
  if you own a compiler. Version 1.1, includes source.
  Author: Joerg Anslik<p>UnknownGirl Another small musical piece similar in execution to
  &quot;Synthemania&quot; on disk number 153. Binary only. Author:
