IMHO, the golden rules for database setup are:<p>- Spend a lot of time designing your schema. Then spend some more time.<p>- Do not skimp on data integrity measures like proper primary&#x2F;foreign keys<p>- Pay attention to potential usage patterns and build indices for performance; this is not a one-time activity, keep observing the usage and look out for hot-spots<p>Some other tangential points that are often overlooked:<p>- Do not push all your business logic into a hairball of nested stored procs and triggers; debugging&#x2F;testing all that is a bitch compared to writing unit&#x2F;integration tests or dropping into debugger in an IDE. You can be a million times more expressive in a full-featured modern language like Java or C# etc. The main exception to this is when you need to push&#x2F;transform tons of data around and all of it is on the database - a well tuned stored proc would be orders of magnitude faster. This is also not something is needed frequently and could be symptomatic of a bigger issue.<p>- Tons of database trips are expensive; an efficient join instead can do wonders for the performance. If you are doing that all the time, maybe its time to put that behind a view. Also, cache what you can and be conservative about it.<p>- If you are almost always including a filter clause in all your joins, maybe you can explore partitioning.<p>Basically imagine the database like an appliance that does only a few things but those things are FUNDAMENTAL so we ensure that it does them very very well. Don&#x27;t make it make your coffee too (though PostgreSQL probably can do even that efficiently).<p>&gt; There were other factors too, such as depending on Rails to validate uniqueness rather than the database. It resulted in a lot of messy data cleanup that I had to deal with which were causing hard to diagnose issues because race conditions will always happen.<p>&gt; Second, the database is the only place that can make guarantees about data integrity so use them.<p>Thats what I meant.</div><br/><div id="36027898" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36027898" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pyrale</span><span>|</span><a href="#36027761">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36028267">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36027898">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36027898">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; IMHO, the golden rules for database setup are:<p>Typically, these rules are not what people mean when they say they use their DB as a dumb data store.
