As far as I know, all of those are down for one single purpose which is VoLTE (And VoWifi, and other related features which all go under the umbrella of &quot;IMS&quot;). On top of that, they also need to do IPSec (should be pretty safe) and SIP (gosh wait too much string handling). The remote Pixel security flaw few months ago was in that VoLTE stack.<p>This stack should NOT be in an embedded closed source un-auditable system. It should be in a &quot;dumb&quot; sandboxed opensource app in a sandboxed language.<p>This is exactly what I&#x27;m doing: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;phhusson&#x2F;ims">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;phhusson&#x2F;ims</a> This is a FLOSS VoLTE + VoWifi[1] implementation for Android written in kotlin with no native code [2].<p>I&#x27;m not recommending it for anyone (I managed to make my first outgoing call with it yesterday), it has real issues (you do want baseband cooperation on various parts, like QoS or roaming to 3G, which I&#x27;m choosing to ignore), but I think software IMS is the way of the future.<p>In addition to security, this allows for a lot of de-obsoleting:<p>- It helps *a lot* for custom Android ROMs, and compatibility with annoying carriers<p>- I can integrate top-notch audio codecs (EVS) without breaking a sweat, and deployed for everyone in a jiffy (heck I don&#x27;t even to reboot user&#x27;s smartphone&#x27;s to apply the change, I can just deploy it over Play Store)<p>- I can integrate modern voice improvements<p>- I can enable VoWifi on 3G smartphones (Granted, I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s extremely useful)<p>- I can enable features that didn&#x27;t exist when that smartphone model got released like Cross-Sim VoWifi (you have your french main SIM, you&#x27;re in the US with a local eSIM, you can do VoWifi of the french SIM over the local eSIM to have cheap 4G voice calls)<p>I see some movement in AOSP source code that make me think Google will release an opensource IMS within two years, so I&#x27;m hopeful my work will be able to go to the trash.<p>[1] I&#x27;m kinda cheating for the wifi part, because it&#x27;s provided by AOSP, I barely lifted the little finger to enable it.

So now you got bad software in a sandbox that may or may not be safe and is less performant than the low level variant. Maybe the software is bad in a kind that allows abuse despite the sandbox, congrats now your baseband lies to you.<p>The solution I like is to use strictly typed languages, formaly verified compliers, a ton of tests and fuzzing and above all: avoiding unnecessary complexity.

Many standards organizations require you to open the patents to anyone implementing the specifications managed by that organization if you wish to be part of the committee and introduce your technology to it, and the relevant policy here is a joint ITU-T&#x2F;ITU-R&#x2F;ISO&#x2F;IEC governing agreement to do so.<p>3GPP was developed as a way to sidestep such mandatory agreements, while still being an ITU-managed spec. The company that is gaining the most advantage from this loophole is Qualcomm.<p>&gt; Google &quot;did&quot; secure a win, didn&#x27;t they? They took their ball and went home. They decided to take the Samsung Exynos SoC and modem for their flagship phone.<p>Yes and no. Google and Samsung are jointly putting pressure on Qualcomm that Apple couldn&#x27;t. Both of them have patents that are part of the LTE patent pool as well, and key ones that would cripple Qualcomm if either of them pulled out.<p>Apple, through their Intel LTE acquisition, did not have as much leverage, even though Intel was the only other company was ready to compete in the 5G space and had patents relevant to 5G.<p>I believe Qualcomm, if they wished to push the issue, could also force both companies to settle. They may do so in the future.<p>&gt; ... because they&#x27;re better than the competition - including their acquisition? Is it your contention that Qualcomm somehow forced Apple to pick them over their own?<p>I do not believe so. Most of what was wrong with the first post-acquisition gen modems was Intel mismanagement of the product line (the same way they do to every other product of theirs). LTE benchmarks of the iPhone generation that contained both modems (and it was a random chance on which was in your phone) were mixed. Sometimes the Qualcomm modem was better, sometimes it was Intel.<p>It would be a shame if Apple abandoned the product entirely, and I don&#x27;t think they did. I think this is part of the settlement. So, yes, to answer your question, I believe the settlement requires purchase of Qualcomm modems for x generations. The details of the settlement are not entirely public, other than there is a 2 year supply agreement.<p>You don&#x27;t drop $1B on an acquisition just to get their patent portfolio and then settle and give up forever. You double down and continue working on polishing up that acquisition while the conditions of the settlement expire. I think in 2-3 generations we will see the return of the Intel modem; if we don&#x27;t, I think Apple should go find themselves a new CEO.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38621361" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38621361" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">abdullahkhalids</span><span>|</span><a href="#38617736">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38621151">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38622264">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38617983">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38621361">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38621361">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thank you.
