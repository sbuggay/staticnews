Those are the very people who should <i>be never ever allowed to become mods, or to be anywhere near any position of power</i>. This is how people seeking status and power self-identify, and if they&#x27;re given mod power, you can count on their subreddits going to shit rather quickly, and&#x2F;or them eventually getting bored and quitting, once they realize that being a mod is a hard and thankless job, with people who need you the most hating you the most.<p>Now sure, the current set of moderators isn&#x27;t made of saints and purely selfless people either. But it&#x27;s <i>stable</i>. The worst moderators long ago dropped out, or rode their subreddits down to ground. Reddit ecosystem reached an equilibrium.

A ton of people disagree with that take. The site has grown a massive amount since the new design was released in 2018. So people dont mind it and probably never experienced the old layout. Additionally, the 1st party mobile app sits at #2 (2.6M reviews -- 4.8[1]) vs #10 (up from ~30 in May) for apollo (170.5k reviews -- 4.7[2]).

They are trying to keep the main, core userbase happy.

If you have a site that allows for discussion of any topic like reddit, but optimizes for gigantic pictures and animations and by default your feed is filled with content that is more suited for that (eg, things like cat pictures), then you&#x27;re absolutely going to attract a different audience than a utilitarian pure text site.

It starts at the top:<p>&gt; Huffman, also a Reddit co-founder, said he plans to pursue changes to Reddit’s moderator removal policy to allow ordinary users to vote moderators out more easily if their decisions aren’t popular. He said the new system would be more democratic and allow a wider set of people to hold moderators accountable. [1]<p>If he had modded a big sub, like a city sub for example, he&#x27;d know that you can&#x27;t actually moderate toward popular opinion.<p>Not only because what is popular is not always sustainable. Leadership is doing the right thing even if it is not popular.  But on a less obvious level, this wouldn&#x27;t work because the site doesn&#x27;t handle the influence of astroturfing and brigading.<p>To even provide for fair votes would require user abuse administration tools the site clearly does not have.<p>What a bummer.

Like the additional effort of moderating 100 subreddits vs 1 would be nowhere near 100x.  It would probably be closer to like 5x the amount of work.<p>And there are benefits to moderating many subreddits.<p>Most moderation is keeping your automod filters up to date to stop the never-ending onslaught of porn bots, crypto scammers, and obvious fake accounts looking to farm karma.  Everyday I&#x27;d scan through both the stuff the filters caught and the stuff they didn&#x27;t and tweak the automod settings to be better, then most of the time I&#x27;d copy paste those settings across subs.<p>The other hard part of being a mod is communicating with the other mods.  Like I would only be online moderating one hour out of the day and so all communication with async with anonymous strangers.  This again benefits from having mods span many subreddits because you can quickly get to know the other moderators in similar spaces and you all pass information around to each other.<p>For subs that require user verification this again is a better user experience if you moderate several similar subs because users can verify with you once and be approved across many subs.<p>The communities actually tend to do a pretty good job of moderating themselves via reporting and downvoting so even if there&#x27;s only one mod on a subreddit they act way more like an appeals process than an initial judge of fate, most content moderation is actually outsourced to the community as a whole with the mods only responsible for curating a space free of obvious spam and acting as an appeals process for people who have content on the borderline.</div><br/><div id="36351662" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36351662" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">FemmeAndroid</span><span>|</span><a href="#36351163">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36351513">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36351590">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36351662">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36351662">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks for writing this down.

You&#x27;d probably get more milage out of a way to force community members to take turns serving as moderators than you would having a mechanism to remove existing mods.<p>When someone says Reddit moderator you&#x27;re thinking of &#x2F;r&#x2F;news or &#x2F;r&#x2F;funny not the person running the sub for their favorite book or local sports team or interest group.  There are way more of those moderators and you almost need to handle the two use cases differently.<p>For the truly top subreddits I think Reddit should be employing people directly or indirectly to do the moderation.  At the very least they should be compensating those people and reviewing their performance.<p>Reddit should also make better mod tools and do way more to help with moderation.  It&#x27;s offensively bad what they offer today.  If Reddit actually gave a damn they would force every software engineer at the company to spend 2 weeks as the moderator of a subreddit once a year and I guarantee this problem would be solved quickly.<p>I also think some semblance of moderator hierarchy would be extremely helpful.  Have some sort of mod council that oversees all of Ask* subreddits and another for sports subreddits and another for NSFW subreddits.  Those content domains will all have similar needs and having someone looking at the bigger picture across individual subs would be very helpful.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36352496" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36352496" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mrtksn</span><span>|</span><a href="#36351163">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36351513">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36351590">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36351661">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36352496">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36352496">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thank you for writing these interesting insights.

By default, when you make a subreddit you&#x27;re the moderator.<p>Then once that subreddit grew a little bit two things happened: first moderators of similar subreddits asked if I would be willing to help them out on their subs.  The second was that moderators from other subreddits who enjoyed the community would reach out and ask if I needed any help moderating the sub.  I both cases I said sure and eventually I ended up just being added to a bunch of subreddits as a moderator.<p>I would spend about an hour a day doing it and I think I kept it up as long as I did for the social aspect of it - I didn&#x27;t want to burden the other moderators by leaving.<p>Then there was a highly politically charged let&#x27;s say discussion that cropped up on the subreddit around some specific language (think similar to the default git branch being called &quot;master&quot;).

Nobody wants a feed without content in it anymore than staring at an empty email account, so you kind of need one of those things to jumpstart it.<p>There are so many different niches out of what people want out of a reddit replacement though.  Some people want anonymous, some don&#x27;t, some want local mod curation, others want a very broad push-based thing with lots of server feeding, and there are a lot of these underlying disagreements that are underlying a lot of the &quot;what would replace it&quot; thing.<p>It&#x27;s always fun until someone starts shitflooding gore and the mods on that server don&#x27;t handle it and there&#x27;s some other problem that&#x27;s the fifth this week.

Selfishly I almost wish this had been their course of action -- restrict API access to Reddit Gold members, or some such.<p>Reddit Gold is $5.99&#x2F;month, so 5-6x their average monthly income per user. Hell, they could just make it $2 a month.<p>Source, not sure how reliable: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sacra.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;reddit&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sacra.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;reddit&#x2F;</a><p>One downside to this is that while $5.99&#x2F;month is affordable to many, for other people (particularly those in other parts of the world) it is completely unaffordable.

Reddit costs a ton of money to run and has never been profitable enough to be default &#x27;alive&#x27;. If something doesn&#x27;t change then Reddit is dead, so from the managements point of view all they&#x27;ve done is increased the problems rather than reduced them.<p>It&#x27;s super easy to criticize the Reddit management for their inability to articulate what is going on behind the scenes but in my view that only means that there is no good news. Reddit is hanging by a thread financially and this revolt has made it worse. So reducing the ability of the moderators to revolt is a first logical step in the direction of stability, which is where they will need to go.<p>Spez should step down, he&#x27;s made way too many unforced errors.

I can&#x27;t claim any credit for it, it&#x27;s from Jim Rutt, I heard him on the Clearer Thinking podcast (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;podcast.clearerthinking.org&#x2F;episode&#x2F;160&#x2F;jim-rutt-large-language-models-deep-peace-and-the-meaning-crisis&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;podcast.clearerthinking.org&#x2F;episode&#x2F;160&#x2F;jim-rutt-lar...</a>).<p>He basically argues that LLMs are going to mean that vast quantities of the content on the internet are going to become automatically-generated drivel which no-one wants to actually read. I think this is pretty plausible. So in order to consume information from the internet, it will basically be a requirement to use an AI tool which, for a given query that you might have, will go out and retrieve all the information on it from many different sources, and return them, appropriately listed and summarised. Such a tool would probably want API access to the likes of Reddit, but would also make the main value prop of the way social media works currently (getting ads in front of eyeballs) useless. So end users will probably end up having to pay for their API use so that their tools can access these sites, and as a pleasant side effect they&#x27;ll see no ads. So perhaps we&#x27;ll end up at the promised utopia where users pay a little bit for the content that they like, and don&#x27;t see ads along the way, as a result of AI. I have no idea how likely this is, but it sounds pretty good to me if it does work out like that.</div><br/><div id="36351956" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36351956" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">b800h</span><span>|</span><a href="#36351555">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36351693">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36353097">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36351956">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36351956">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">And then they&#x27;ll put ads in the LLM chat stream. &quot;Using texts on neurolinguistic programming and mentalism, find subliminal ways of promoting {product}&quot;.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36353097" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36353097" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ttepasse</span><span>|</span><a href="#36351555">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36351693">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36351935">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36353097">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36353097">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">They could simply discriminate against LLMs via their APIs terms of service.
