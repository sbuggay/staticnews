You seem to have a very very rudimentary understanding of accounting and have conflated expenses with losses. An expense is not a loss. If you buy a factory for $1 million, you didn&#x27;t lose $1 million dollars. You now have an asset, a factory, that is worth approximately $1 million. You don&#x27;t get to go to the IRS and say &quot;I lost $1 million dollars this year because I bought a factory&quot;. The IRS will tell you, no you didn&#x27;t. You still have your $1 million, it&#x27;s just now in the form of a factory instead of cash.<p>Likewise, WB spent money and created an asset, a film. That film has a market value. Maybe they don&#x27;t like the film, but that doesn&#x27;t change the reality that it&#x27;s worth something. We <i>know</i> approximately how much it&#x27;s worth because several other companies made offers to buy it.<p>Instead WB wants to lie and say it isn&#x27;t worth anything. So, no I don&#x27;t like how they are running their company when they want to lie and cheat to get out of paying the taxes they owe.

You&#x27;d need some company with enough money to buy a produced movie (even if at a discount) who also thinks they could release it and make enough money on it to cover their costs AND who will also be willing to take on all the contractual obligations like licensing and residuals. And chances are in addition to all of that, they also have to be willing to license the various properties that the movie studio already owns (or worse, re-negotiate the rights from the original holders that the studio had already previously negotiated).<p>It&#x27;s also important to remember that those expenses would have been written off whether or not the movie was released. My understanding here is the only difference between releasing and not releasing the movie is whether that write off occurs over 3-5 years, or all in this year</div><br/></div></div><div id="39340682" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39340682" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sokoloff</span><span>|</span><a href="#39339420">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39339883">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39340096">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39339961">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39340682">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39340682">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you decide to rebuild your HQ, you may well have to destroy the old one, even if someone would have bought it from you.<p>When a developer buys a property, razes it, and builds a new building there, all those costs and actions are permitted.<p>I find it amusing that a studio, who is almost surely getting professional tax advice with full knowledge of the facts and circumstances, is having the legality of the proposed course of action not just questioned but outright confidently asserted as contrary to the law based on an article that’s light on details.</div><br/><div id="39341134" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39341134" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ambichook</span><span>|</span><a href="#39339420">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39340682">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39339961">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39341134">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39341134">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; is having the legality of the proposed course of action not just questioned but outright confidently asserted as contrary to the law based on an article that’s light on details.<p>i&#x27;m confused, is the article saying that its illegal, or is it saying that it <i>ought</i> to be illegal? i for one agree with that attitude, or at the very least believe that a studio shouldnt be able to get a tax writeoff for just sending a completed film to the void.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39339961" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39339961" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gruez</span><span>|</span><a href="#39339420">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39339883">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39340682">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39341185">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39339961">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39339961">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;If you destroyed it, that was your choice, but you didn&#x27;t thereby incur a loss of $30M.

After all, those talk show appearances of all your stars don&#x27;t come cheap. And your &quot;major theaters&quot; are going to insist on advertising. They&#x27;re not going to block out precious screens and show times for a movie you&#x27;re not going to advertise. And that&#x27;s before we talk about actual physical media distribution, replacements for losses or damaged media, tracking and auditing your ticket sales and everything else that goes into getting eyeballs in front of screens turned into cash in your income bucket.<p>&gt; And if it&#x27;s that bad then why don&#x27;t you sell to a streaming service for one million dollars? Then you only have to deliver a few files and nothing else.<p>On a multi-million dollar film, that&#x27;s almost certainly less than the value of the tax write-off, and again may incur costs well and above any revenue. You&#x27;ll need licensing contracts, lawyer time, accounting time, and again, all the various contractual obligations that kick in on release.<p>&gt;Contracts based on revenue are fine in this situation, aren&#x27;t they? If you only get moderately low revenue, then you don&#x27;t pay much into them.<p>1) They can still make it impossible to recover enough of the expense costs to make releasing the film worthwhile. As a simplified example, if you spend $50 million making a film, spend $10 million distributing it, earn $15 million in gross revenue, and pay $7 million in gross revenue contracts, you&#x27;re in the hole an additional $2 million, not counting all the expenses incurred tracking and paying on those contracts.<p>2) You still need to expect to make your expenses back, regardless. Again in the above example, say instead your gross revenue contracts are only $2 million. Great, you&#x27;ve earned $13 million, on an expenses budget of $60 million. Not even close to beginning to pay for the expenses incurred.</div><br/><div id="39342205" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39342205" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Dylan16807</span><span>|</span><a href="#39339345">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39341949">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39339797">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39342205">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39342205">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m not talking about advertising.

In the streaming era, it&#x27;s very easy for the revenue created by hosting an older piece of content to be dwarfed by residuals.

You&#x27;re still in the hole $50M. Let&#x27;s say that you sell the film for $20M and write off the remaining $60M loss for a $23M benefit. In the latter case, you&#x27;re only in the hole $37M instead of $50M. That&#x27;s a lot better.<p>Is there some weird accounting rule where you&#x27;re allowed to write off full losses, but not partial losses? I understand writing off losses: if you make $100M on one project and lose $50M on another project, you pay taxes on the $50M you&#x27;ve made - but you&#x27;re only getting a fraction of the money back. It&#x27;s better to get 100% of $20M plus a fraction of $60M than getting a fraction of $80M.<p>No one seems to be explaining how this is working in Warner Bros Discovery&#x27;s favor. Sure, I get canceling popular shows where the actors might be looking for more expensive contracts. I might think it&#x27;s short sighted given that you need popular shows to keep your subscribers, but I get what they&#x27;re trying to do. I understand licensing content to a competitor for a quick pay day. Again, it seems short sighted, but I get what they&#x27;re trying to do. What I don&#x27;t get is why it&#x27;s better for them to completely scrap content than to let it flop upon release. The only possible explanation I can see is that they&#x27;d be able to claim the tax relief earlier. If they released it in late 2023, they&#x27;d have to wait to claim any losses since they&#x27;d be making money off it into 2024. If they cancel it in 2023, they can take the write off for 2023.
