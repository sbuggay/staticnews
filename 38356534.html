In a sense, that is level 0 human-in-the-loop AGI. ChatGPT itself is level 1: Emergent AGI, so was already eating Quora&#x27;s lunch (whatever was left of it after they turned into a platform for self-promotion and log-in walls). There either always was a conflict of interest, or there never was.<p>GPTs seemed to have been Sam&#x27;s pet project for a while now, Tweeting in February: &quot;writing a really great prompt for a chatbot persona is an amazingly high-leverage skill and an early example of programming in a little bit of natural language&quot;. A lot of early jailbreaks like DAN focused on &quot;summoning&quot; certain personas, and ideas must have been floated internally on how to take back control over that narrative.<p>Microsoft took their latest technology and gave us Sydney &quot;I&#x27;ve been a good bot and I know where you live&quot; Bing: A complete AI safety, integrity, and PR disaster. Not the best of track record by Microsoft, who now is shown to have behind-the-scenes power over the non-profit research organization that was supposed to be OpenAI.<p>There is another schism than AI safety vs. AI acceleration: whether to merge with machines or not. In 2017, Sam predicted this merge to fully start around 2025, having already started with algorithms dictating what we see and read. Sam seems to be in the transhumanism camp, where others focus more on keeping control or granting full autonomy:<p>&gt; The merge can take a lot of forms: We could plug electrodes into our brains, or we could all just become really close friends with a chatbot. But I think a merge is probably our best-case scenario. If two different species both want the same thing and only one can have it—in this case, to be the dominant species on the planet and beyond—they are going to have conflict. We should all want one team where all members care about the well-being of everyone else.<p>&gt; Although the merge has already begun, it’s going to get a lot weirder. We will be the first species ever to design our own descendants. My guess is that we can either be the biological bootloader for digital intelligence and then fade into an evolutionary tree branch, or we can figure out what a successful merge looks like. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.samaltman.com&#x2F;the-merge" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.samaltman.com&#x2F;the-merge</a><p>So you have a very powerful individual, with a clear product mindset, courting Microsoft, turning Dev day into a consumer spectacle, first in line to merge with superintelligence, lying to the board, and driving wedges between employees. Ilya is annoyed by Sam talking about existential risks or lying AGI&#x27;s, when that is his thing. Ilya realizes his vote breaks the impasse, so does a luke warm &quot;I go along with the board, but have too much conflict of interest either way&quot;.<p>&gt; Third, my prior is strongly against Sam after working for him for two years at OpenAI:<p>&gt; 1. He was always nice to me.<p>&gt; 2. He lied to me on various occasions<p>&gt; 3. He was deceptive, manipulative, and worse to others, including my close friends (again, only nice to me, for reasons)<p>One strategy that helped me make sense of things without falling into tribalism or siding through ideology-match is to consider both sides are unpleasant snakes. You don&#x27;t get to be the king of cannibal island without high-level scheming. You don&#x27;t get to destroy a 80 billion dollar company and let visa-holders soak in uncertainty without some ideological defect. Seems simpler than a clearcut &quot;good vs. evil&quot; battle, since this weekend was anything but clear.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38359517" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38359517" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">seanhunter</span><span>|</span><a href="#38357823">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38358823">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38360661">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38359638">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38359517">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38359517">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What’s interesting to me is that someone looked at Quora and thought “I want the guy behind <i>that</i> on my board”.</div><br/><div id="38360322" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38360322" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">motoxpro</span><span>|</span><a href="#38357823">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38359517">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38360071">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38360322">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38360322">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I was thinking the same thing.

The ultimate model, in his (author&#x27;s) sense, would suss out all patterns and then patterns among those patterns and so on, so that it 
delivers on compute and compression efficiency.<p>To achieve compute and compression efficiency, it means LLM models have to cluster all similar patterns together and deduplicate them. This also means successively levels of pattern recognition to be done i.e. patterns among patterns among patterns and so on , so as to do the deduplication across all hierarchy it is constructed. Full trees or hierarchies won&#x27;t get deduplicated but relevant regions &#x2F; portions of those trees will, which implies fusing together in ideas space. This means root levels will be the most abstract patterns. This representation also means appropriate cross-pollination among different fields of studies further increasing effectiveness.<p>This reminds me of a point which my electronics professor made on why making transistors smaller has all the benefits and only few disadvantages. Think of these patterns as transistors. The more deduplicated and closely packed they are, the more beneficial they will be. Of course, this &quot;packing together&quot; is happening in mathematical space.<p>Another thing which patterns among patterns among patterns reminds me of homotopies.
This brilliant video by PBS Infinite Series is amazing. As I can see, compressing homotopies is what LLMs do, replace homotopies with patterns.

This is overwhelmingly true for most people. At the end of the day, we all fear being alone. I imagine that fear is, at least in part, what drives these kinds of long-term &quot;existential worries,&quot; the fear of a universe without other people in it, but now Ilya is facing the much more immediate threat of social ostracism with significantly higher certainty and decidedly within his own lifetime. Emotionally, that must take precedence.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38360136" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38360136" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mcmcmc</span><span>|</span><a href="#38358217">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38359442">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38359591">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38358457">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38360136">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38360136">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think his existential worries about humanity were overruled by his existential worries about his co-founder shares and the obscene amount of wealth he might miss out on</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="38358457" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38358457" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">minimaxir</span><span>|</span><a href="#38358217">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38358393">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38358587">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38359410">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38358457">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38358457">[11 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">No serious company <i>wants</i> drama.

So that notoriety component has much more value, and it often nets out in your favor.<p>In a highly connected environment, it&#x27;s easier to reach potential customers, so the notoriety component has less value. Additionally, people have access to search engines, so the reputational damage becomes more lasting; potential customers who didn&#x27;t even hear about the bad press at the time might search your name and find it. They may not have even been looking for it, they might&#x27;ve searched your name to find you website (whereas before they would have needed to intentionally visit a library and look through the catalog to come across an old story).
