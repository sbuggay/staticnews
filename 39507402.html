Coming from Europe it is difficult to appreciate at first.  But when you see headlines like:
&quot;Roma was purchased last month by Texas car dealership magnate Dan Friedkin, who is worth $4.1 billion.&quot;<p>Yes, that a Texan car dealership buying the AS Roma (soccer team, Italian capital).<p>When I came in US, I had no car, I saved money, went to dealership (Toyota) and pointed a used Matrix, test drive it, and said, I will buy it.  The guy started to show me a long form (like 3 letter pages long form)... I said I do not want to make a loan.  He looked at me like I came from another planet.  I want to buy the car.  He said that he can only accept a bank check.  It was close to noon on Saturday, I asked if he could drive me with the Matrix to the nearest bank quickly, he reluctantly said yes.  Maybe he thought I was going to scam him or something.  He did stay in the car, while I asked for a bank check.  He drove me back to the dealership.  Unfortunately I had to leave the car, so they do a final inspection and prepare some papers.  I came a week later to pick up the car.<p>Clearly the sales guy seemed a bit puzzled by the transaction.  But there was no way I was going to drag a car purchase process like describe in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kutinden&#x2F;buyingacar&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;README.md">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kutinden&#x2F;buyingacar&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;README.md</a> (13 steps !?)<p>Now I see the why Tesla sells online.

Here are the steps that I took.<p>1. Test drove four different brands<p>2. Went to six banks and found out the lowest interest rate I could get. Everyone told me that it would be at a credit union but instead it was a brand new bank that apparently was hungry to get new business<p>3. Emailed every dealer for the brand I chose within 225 miles.<p>4. You want to do one thing at a time.  I wanted the price out the door.  I avoided talk about trade-ins or financing.  But I did state I was open to financing the vehicle with them if they were competitive.<p>5. Be very patient.  The vast majority of the dealerships in the first round either never answered the email or quoted me over MSRP.  I would engage with everyone who wrote me back.  I would reiterate that I was ready to buy a new vehicle to whomever gave me the best deal.  As time went on I responded with specific price I was willing to pay.  There are forums for most brands where people share the prices that they were paying.  So I had a pretty good idea what might get accepted.<p>6. I was getting ready to start shopping for my second choice.  It came down to a single salesman who sent me dozens of emails.  All the sales guys want you in the dealership where you&#x27;re on their turf.  This guy kept dropping the price $500 at a time.  He asked me what it would take for me to visit the dealership.  I quoted him $1000 below his last offer - and he accepted!  I made it clear that wasn&#x27;t a price I would accept, just enough for me to visit him.  I wanted $1000 more I when visited the dealership.<p>7.  I got a bunch of prices for my old vehicle online so I had an idea what it would bring.  They quoted me on the high end of what I would receive but they wouldn&#x27;t budge on the new vehicle price.  Eventually they agreed to add $500 to the price of the trade-in which I wearily accepted.  Only to have them give me $400 of free mats so its obvious that I probably could have gotten them lower. However they had factory financing that was 1.25% lower than the best bank rate I received so I financed the vehicle with them.<p>Going online is the only way to purchase a vehicle.  December I learned later is a really good time to purchase.</div><br/><div id="39508982" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39508982" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">globular-toast</span><span>|</span><a href="#39508551">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39508676">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39508982">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39508982">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Jesus.

Get preapproved with your bank or and other bank and get the preapproval letter ready before step 5.<p>That seems unlikely to me, though this depends on which car company you&#x27;re buying from.<p>Take Ford for instance. A significant amount of Ford&#x27;s business is banking&#x2F;financing. Much like how the Dealership wants to sell you a car, Ford actively wants to be your financier and they&#x27;re competing against the banks to get your business.<p>Furthermore: Ford is known to sweeten the deal and offer financing-credits rather than straight $$$ off of a car. For example, you might find that Ford can offer 5% right now, when typical banks are going to be offering 8%. This is effectively Ford choosing a &quot;shadow-discount&quot; in the form of financing-incentive. They&#x27;re willing to lose money on the finance but gain a customer. Its a hidden negotiating tactic on top of all the other offers they&#x27;re doing to you. You might as well give the sales-guy the opportunity to offer you a financing deal.<p>-----------<p>But Toyota doesn&#x27;t have as big of a financing arm, and its more of an (expensive) service to the customer. You&#x27;ll probably lose money on Toyota financing compared to a regular bank.<p>I think its a good idea to be pre-approved. This means that you know what the &quot;fair&quot; % interest rate should be right now, and get a good idea of what &quot;shadow deals&quot; various car manufacturers are doing.<p>I know I&#x27;ve seen 1.9% APY deals in the market today. Financing is seriously just another step in this annoying negotiation process you have to normalize and account for.</div><br/><div id="39508322" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39508322" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">whakim</span><span>|</span><a href="#39508142">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39508242">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39508322">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39508322">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Many car dealers work directly with banks to provide financing for customers. In these cases, the car dealers take a cut, so a customer who walks into the same bank might be pre-approved for a lower interest rate. (This doesn&#x27;t always apply to big institutions like Chase and Ally that have huge, separate direct and indirect auto lending arms that never talk to each other.) But this profit is totally arbitrary - dealers can choose to make no profit (or even lose money) on financing if it helps them to make a sale. Most people don&#x27;t realize this because you can&#x27;t walk into your local credit union and negotiate the terms of an auto loan. That being said, even at $0 profit it&#x27;s hard for dealer financing to beat a direct auto loan, because you (the customer) get your pick of the world&#x27;s financial institutions, whereas the dealer is restricted to the lenders they happen to partner with.<p>Relatedly, it <i>is</i> significantly more convenient to accept dealer financing because you don&#x27;t have to act as a middleman between the car dealer and your bank.<p>The point is that dealer financing is <i>usually</i> a rip-off (because it&#x27;s fundamentally another axis along which dealers try to extract money from you), but it can still occasionally be a good deal.</div><br/><div id="39508406" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39508406" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dragontamer</span><span>|</span><a href="#39508142">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39508322">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39508838">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39508406">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39508406">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; That being said, even at $0 profit it&#x27;s hard for dealer financing to beat a direct auto loan, because you (the customer) get your pick of the world&#x27;s financial institutions, whereas the dealer is restricted to the lenders they happen to partner with.<p>You&#x27;re underestimating the power that the car-based financial institutions have.<p>For example:<p>&gt;  (This doesn&#x27;t always apply to big institutions like Chase and Ally that have huge, separate direct and indirect auto lending arms that never talk to each other.)<p>Speaking of Ally bank... have you ever looked at their name before 2008?<p>GMAC: That&#x27;s General Motors Acceptance Corporation.

The problem was that the technical price negotiation worked so incredibly well that I basically got (politely) thrown out of the dealership.<p>The tactic was simple: disarming empathy. It was a method presented by a hostage negotiator via this NPR podcast: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;transcripts&#x2F;167802325" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;transcripts&#x2F;167802325</a> Basically you agree with the salesman that whatever price they are offering is actually very fair, and in a normal situation you would accept it... but you apologize profusely saying you just can&#x27;t spend this much because it is too expensive for you. When he says such and such product quality justifies the price, you wholeheartedly agree with him... but you can&#x27;t afford this.<p>So that day I had identified a specific car I wanted, online, at a dealer in my area. I went in to see it in person. I explained I was ready to buy it today, got sat down at a desk with one of their salesmen. And he starts by presenting his price. I explained it&#x27;s a really good price, but I really can&#x27;t afford that, and asks if there is anything they can do to reduce it? After a while he says, sure, OK, what about this new number? And basically I keep doing the same thing over and over. I profusely thank him for reducing the price, but explains it&#x27;s still too much. Over a span of 20 minutes, he cuts the price down 5 or 6 times, up to a point where I finally say we&#x27;ve reached a price that I am able to afford. I don&#x27;t remember the numbers but I think we had started around $19k and got down to $16k. The salesman is mildly happy, but I distinctively remember him not being that enthusiastic. He said he&#x27;s going to get the paperwork ready to finalize the sale. He leaves me at his desk while he walks way. And a few minutes later he comes back, with a very sad look on his face, and apologizes while explaining that the owner of the dealership refused to let the sale close at this price. He says there is nothing he can do for me, shakes my hand, and remains awkwardly silent, then apologetically stood up to make me understand it was time to leave. I kept thinking the guy probably had just been yelled at by the owner about he could have screwed up the negotiation so badly.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39508474" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39508474" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">resolutebat</span><span>|</span><a href="#39508692">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39508073">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39508474">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39508474">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The opportunity to sidestep all this bullshit was a huge reason why I went with Tesla instead.

I own a 95` landcruiser with 300k on the clock and i beleive it has another 300 which will basically mean it will do me for life.

In the 10yrs ive owned it, my car has increased in value by ~40%. Its made of metal, and is held together with bolts not glue. It will not dry rot away, and rust is easily controlled with modern epoxy paints. It will not go out of fashion given the thirst car collectors of the future will have the past.<p>My plan is to swap a hydrogen motor in i guess once mature the tech and consequently ban diesel.<p>This is from someone who in 2005 bought his first ~50k$ car over the internet, one click style, without seeing it in person from a used car guy (it was 2nd hand, 10k on the clock, ~10% of retailm had 2yrs warrenty). Thats really the problem with buying a one-click these days though, the people who buy them are too risk adverse to be without a warrenty or buy second hand. So they crash the value of their own investments because the others know what to expect with seconds on a modern car. The reason people sell cars after 1 or 2 years is many, in my country, leasing cars like this is maximises your dollar vs tax.<p>Any moden car: ~50k outlay, 10yr useful life<p>vs<p>i bought a 2002 rav4 with 400k for ~2k, 5~ yrs ago. Ive spent roughly ~500$ repairing different things on it in that time putting on ~40k because they reused the same parts for this car across many different years and models which means CHEAP CHEAP. It means parts have been copied and mass reproduced on a scale that sees me paying $30 for a waterpump and ~1hr to install DIY on the side of the road not $600 ~ $2k labour for a moden car that requires half the car to be dissaembled to even just see the water pump. And since your modern pump is made of plastic, and all the pipes are plastic, and the pipes are have special numbers of propritiy fittings.... well yes, you see why modern cars suck in terms of investment ratio.<p>let me show you that math.
~2.5k outlay &#x2F; 5yrs = ~500$ per year total cost. The car is now worth ~10-12k because people are so sick of modern cars and toyotas keep their value.<p>2nd hand, high milage, reliable cars (toyota&#x2F;honda) &gt; anything modern made in the last ~15yrs. The morphing from 1 or 2 modules per car, to 20-100 modules per car with tonnes more emmisions gear IMO is the worse thing to happen to cars since their inception. BUT it has given me a retirement plan ... im thinking about becoming a ECU&#x2F;electronics repairer once i get sick of tech :D All those modules are pretty much the same, they just allow you todo things via comment instead of lever. Once you learn the basics, its like hacking on VB or JS.</div><br/><div id="39508693" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39508693" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">valval</span><span>|</span><a href="#39508575">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39508588">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39508693">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39508693">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Look, this guy totally invented driving an old beater instead of a modern car!<p>Inspired by you, I&#x27;ve started using a Nokia 3310 instead of those new iPhones that keep getting more expensive and last for two years MAX!</div><br/></div></div><div id="39508588" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39508588" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eru</span><span>|</span><a href="#39508575">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39508693">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39508588">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39508588">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; My plan is to swap a hydrogen motor in i guess once they get of diesel.<p>Why?</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
