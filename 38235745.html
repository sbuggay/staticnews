But for the most part, they&#x27;re pretty good about litter boxes. I&#x27;ve never seen one of my rats actually relieve themselves out of their cage. Just the territorial markers.<p>Rats are probably my favorite animal that I&#x27;ve kept. They really are as intelligent, personable, and expressive as dogs. But they&#x27;re very clean animals, one of their man activities is social grooming. Males tend to be lazy and want to cuddle while females are more driven to explore their environment. They&#x27;re also not strictly nocturnal or diurnal, but will adjust their sleep.schedule to match your activity. They sleep while you&#x27;re at work, but want to play first thing in the morning and when you come home.<p>The only downside is that their maximum lifespan is about three years, and they need a specialty vet.

Billions of years ago, mammals didn&#x27;t exist and the only things around were more like plankton or algae and had nothing like a &quot;base model&quot; we could say we somehow inherited. The earliest ape-like creatures appeared around 10M years ago.<p>The first mammals appeared around 225M years ago so you could potentially argue that our &quot;base model&quot; first started evolving around then but I still think it&#x27;s something of a stretch to compare this kind &quot;training&quot; to the ways we are training modern neural networks. The &quot;base model&quot; at this time was simply survival, eat, reproduce, survive, and enough circuitry to manage your base biological functions.<p>We are essentially running the entire volume of human knowledge through a neural network through billions of iterations and the model itself has 175 billion plus parameters. Humans nor any of our evolutionary ancestors never received this kind of &quot;training&quot;, it&#x27;s simply not comparable at all. Our mammalian ancestors were exposed to &quot;basic&quot; natural environments, they were not &quot;pushed&quot; into artifical situations to learn tool usage or language.<p>If we look at when apes first came about (10M years) ago and let&#x27;s say since then the average ape or humanoid lived to 30-40 years, and estimate the average generation length for apes at 20 years (which is roughly accurate according to the latest research). This means that since the first recorded apes there have been about 500&#x27;000 generations of apes and humans. (12&#x27;000 generations for humans only).<p>So now if you compare how we are training our models, GPT-3 at 175B parameters and billions of iterations of training, GPT-4 we don&#x27;t know. And again, extremely focused and specific training, feeding the entire human generated corpus of language, mathemetics, logic, etc etc into it, and we get something that does pretty well at human language.<p>Humans have a &quot;base model&quot; as you put it which really hasn&#x27;t been trained for many generations and has been mostly exposed at random to external stimuli in an ad-hoc, unfocused way, and no single individual has ever been exposed to even a fraction of a fraction of a percent as much stimuli as a GPT model. So there is something different going on with our brain and neural networks and I think it can&#x27;t really be compared at all: the mechanisms, numbers, and crucially, the results, do not match up in the slightest.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38238037" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38238037" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chongli</span><span>|</span><a href="#38236509">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38237960">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38238307">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38237327">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38238037">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38238037">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The human model isn’t just trained in language though, it’s trained on the world.

We can tell when a person is looking at us from across the room and tell that apart from someone looking just over our shoulder at someone else.<p>I think most of what we ascribe to intelligence in LLMs is a kind of textual pareidolia. We infer a mind behind the text because our brains are built to recognize minds. That’s how our theory of mind works.<p>But these LLMs know nothing about the world. They might capture some features of the world as patterns that help them better predict what text to generate for us. But that is not the same as knowledge of the world.
