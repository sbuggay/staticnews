Sometimes I have to eselect news read and make a decision about something that&#x27;s going out of support, but that&#x27;s very uncommon. It&#x27;s a rolling release that doesn&#x27;t suddenly tell me I&#x27;m using systemd or insist that now I have to use nginx or whatever.<p>And since it&#x27;s from source, all the compiler toolchain bits are already installed.<p>And I can funroll my loops and fomit my pointers.<p>Everyone should install Gentoo at least once. It&#x27;s not hard, the documentation is excellent (up there with Arch) and you learn things. You may not <i>want</i> to, but you do.<p>Oh, and that color documentation? That made such a huge difference! Everything else was HOWTOs and black and white and here was well-written documentation with <i>colors</i> to help you understand the fixed and movable parts of the commands; <i>chef&#x27;s kiss</i>.<p>Ooooo sys-kernel&#x2F;gentoo-sources-6.1.28 just dropped, time to go!

This was always during python version upgrades (e.g. 3.10 to 3.11), which the docs docs would have you believe is as simple as changing a variable in portage configfile.<p>I was always able to monkeypatch portage to get it working, but it is a problem.<p>I like Gentoo a lot, but I think I liked it more ~ten years ago, when I had more time.

Searching for sys-fs&#x2F;fuse:* in (what used to be called) gentoo-x86 yields only lxd, so the SLOT is providing little value here.<p>Categories are a similar issue in Portage: emerge graphviz asks if I want dev-python&#x2F;graphviz or media-gfx&#x2F;graphviz, but obviously the default should be the latter. Arch instead has python-graphviz and graphviz, which is <i>much better design</i>. Categories fix naming collisions in exactly the wrong way: dumping it on the user and giving no sensible default.<p>For PostgreSQL specifically, Arch provides postgresql and postgresql-old-upgrade, so as long as you don&#x27;t wait years to upgrade your PostgreSQL, you&#x27;ll be fine.

Top class documentation (the title moved to Arch in the meantime) and helpful, supportive and knowledgeable users of their community taught me so much about Linux.

I even remember having proprietary stuff like real video player and flash running on slackware in the early 2000&#x27;s. What most non slackware users, or those that strive for small distros do not understand though, is that to get the most of it you usually do a full installation where everything is included. So it is not a frugal install in term of disk space but it is not huge either. Once you have that, you don&#x27;t really struggle with the lack of dependencies as you rarely have to install a third party app but slackbuilds help you with that when you need it. Having said that with modern software installation methods like flatpak, appimages, nix-env and containers, I don&#x27;t think a 2023 slackware user would be limited in application availability and ease of installation&#x2F;management.<p>His experience of system breakage is something that you wouldn&#x27;t expect from a same vintage slackware installation.<p>I&#x27;ve personnally used gentoo for a time, but I got tired quickly of long build times and keeping my computer on all evenings&#x2F;nights just to do updates.

I&#x27;m just not good enough.<p>I&#x27;ve been trying to like Gentoo for over four years, ever since I installed it on my primary laptop. I love the idea of having the fine-tuned control that Gentoo offers, and I love the idea that everything I install is tailored to my specific system.<p>But despite my best intentions I have not mastered it - in fact I barely feel like I understand it. When I remember to update it <i>a couple times a week</i> everything is pretty smooth. Go much longer than that and all bets are off. If I go on a long vacation I dread coming back to a Gentoo update. I just don&#x27;t have the discipline to keep up.<p>Lately portage has been scolding me because some random packages are trying to install different versions of openssl. I&#x27;ve been ignoring it for weeks while I muster the courage to solve it.<p>And in my experience this kind of problem is super common. Either I&#x27;m pulling multiple versions of a package into the same slot, or I&#x27;m trying to merge a masked package, or some package is trying to put files in a place it doesn&#x27;t own, or who knows...<p>Every time I try to solve one of these issues it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m starting from scratch. I read manpages, online docs, bug trackers. I try various incantations of emerge flags. And eventually I show up the IRC channel with my tail between my legs.<p>Fortunately, the IRC community is extremely knowledgeable and can usually fix my problem in no time. But I hate having to ask for help, and I never seem to get closer to solving them myself.<p>The other major issue I have is convenience: it sometimes takes <i>so long</i> to install a new package. I get it - that&#x27;s what you expect with a source-based distro. But man I did not understand just how much compiling time I&#x27;d need. Krita releases a new patch version? There&#x27;s a couple hours with my laptop fans blasting. My laptop has easily spent 10x or 50x the time compiling Krita vs actually running it! And that&#x27;s just one random program; god help you if you want Firefox on the same machine.<p>Anyway, on my next computer I&#x27;ll probably install Arch.</div><br/><div id="35995990" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35995990" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gerdesj</span><span>|</span><a href="#35995554">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35995687">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35995990">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35995990">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;But despite my best intentions I have not mastered it - in fact I barely feel like I understand it.

When you can repair a broken Gentoo box (which is its default state), whilst still providing service, you are a man my son (pronoun assumption - soz!)<p>I do run Arch on all my personal stuff these days (DebIan n Ubuntu at work and others as required) but Gentoo was my first real love and it taught me to never fear a completely broken Linux box.  Provided the broken bit is not screwed hardware then Gentoo can survive nearly anything.<p>I have a box - a VM running on esxi in my attic that got a bit behind.  By bit, I mean 2013ish - I&#x27;ve just checked out &#x2F;etc&#x2F;kernels to get an idea.  You can use git to make &#x2F;usr&#x2F;portage go back in time and then gradually update your box to now.  It&#x27;s not something that I recommend for the impatient but you can do it.  The worst bit was dealing with things like Let&#x27;s Encrypt CA changes and finding old packages.  I often had to download them manually and slap them in the right place.<p>You complain about compilation times but back in the day I had a laptop that I left running on a glass table for over a week (worried about heat) cranking through what would eventually become @world.  From memory, it was for the GCC 3 -&gt; 4 upgrade and the advice at the time was compile everything until your eyes bleed and then do it again.  Nowadays an ABI change is handled rather better and with better advice.<p>The Gentoo wiki is a very decent repository of info (I wrote some of it, and probably ought to revisit and update my offerings).<p>The contrast with other approaches to software is striking when it comes to docs n that.  I&#x27;ve recently &quot;solved&quot; an MS Outlook MAPI to Exchange snag that might have been easier to diagnose if I had access to the source or logs that weren&#x27;t solely designed for people with access to source code.<p>Do stick with it and do ask for help.
