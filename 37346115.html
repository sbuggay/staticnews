When I was a teenager, I spent a week every summer learning to sail at a sailing course. So, I learned quite a few of those knots. This brings back good memories. As, I&#x27;m Dutch, the names for these knots in English are a bit challenging for me. And honestly, after 35 years, I struggle to name a lot of these knots in Dutch now. But I still know and use a few occasionally. A lot of that becomes muscle memory. If you do use them often enough, it kind of sticks. They are like nice little 3D puzzles and there&#x27;s something satisfying when you figure out how they work. It can be fun to figure a few out while fiddling with a bit of rope.<p>The practicality of knots and their traits is what drives their use. When you deal with boats, you need these knots to perform and not come undone when you are not expecting them to (which could be dangerous). And you also need them come apart when you need them to.<p>Properties like that are what makes a lot of these knots so useful. Technically, you can get by with knowing only a handful. But there are a lot of specialized one with niche usages.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37346735" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37346735" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chadd</span><span>|</span><a href="#37347323">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37346728">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37346735">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37346735">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">One of the things I&#x27;ve learned from teaching knots to Boy &amp; Girl Scouts in the BSA is that you must constantly re-learn them or your skills will founder.

It&#x27;s clearly for a very specific set of circumstances:<p>&gt; The Midshipman’s Hitch Knot is promoted by Ashley (ABOK # 1993, p 325) as the only knot to tie in the following unlikely but critical circumstance: you fall overboard and catch hold of the line which you have prudently left trailing astern and find yourself hanging on with difficulty. Before you tire, you manage to bring the bitter end of the rope around your back. You then have to tie a suitable knot to make a loop around you. A bowline cannot be tied under load. Two Half Hitches will slide and constrict you. The Rolling Hitch is the answer. Even as the second turn is tucked “up” into the correct place, the major strain is taken and the final Half Hitch can be tied with less urgency.</div><br/><div id="37347228" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37347228" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">samcheng</span><span>|</span><a href="#37346728">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37346963">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37347349">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37347228">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37347228">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Nope, that knot is useful surprisingly often!
