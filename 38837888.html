By far the best-run one was the Isle of Man, which (when I lived there) had a population of around 30K. It has an independent parliament (Tynwald, the oldest continuous parliament in the world), and it makes its own laws.<p>The government has very little graft. Politicians seemed to genuinely work for the benefit of their constituents [0]. I always attributed this to the fact that they lived in the communities they served, and the people they socialised with were affected by the decisions they made.<p>The UK has the problem that the politicians are insulated from the people they ostensibly serve. Especially the Tories. They have displayed contempt and arrogance beyond belief.<p>This is all, as you say, a problem of scale.<p>[0] One illustration of this is the Manx implementation of social security vs the UK. When the Manx government set up national insurance contributions, they paid them into a separate fund (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gov.im&#x2F;about-the-government&#x2F;departments&#x2F;the-treasury&#x2F;social-security-division&#x2F;manx-national-insurance-fund&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gov.im&#x2F;about-the-government&#x2F;departments&#x2F;the-trea...</a>) which is under control of the treasury. The UK just poured the national insurance contributions into the general taxation pool.<p>The Manx fund (and by extension their health service) is rolling in money. The UK NHS is broke. The Manx system is proof that there were more than enough contributions to the NHS to keep it adequately funded. But the UK politicians spent the contributions on other things, because they could.</div><br/><div id="38839528" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38839528" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">prox</span><span>|</span><a href="#38838577">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38839110">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38839174">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38839528">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38839528">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thomas Paine in Common Sense also describes that is preferable to have constituents from the places and with work in the community they live in.

The identification of government with society (“we”) went hand in hand with the idea that government should have power in every domain of human life and co-opt or liquidate every competing authority like academia or media or church. Here, it’s that “we” the government should take over healthcare (although regulatory approval of a cancer treatment was cited as one obstacle) and fiber-laying instead of leaving those to non-governmental authorities. Carl Schmitt in the early twentieth century had a great term for such a totalizing government: the Totalstaat. It’s not clear, however, that a Totalstaat is actually a good idea. Governments have never solved many problems at all—-homelessness comes to mind—-and it’s not clear that a government seeking to expand its power into previously non-governmental domains will serve its own interests best by solving problems rather than by providing treatments that abate problems without solving them. Treating a problem expands a state’s authority while preserving the problem as a reason for further government action; solving a problem would end that authority by ending the reason for it.  Winning a war, for example, used to remove the need for a standing army until the twentieth century saw the invention of a “cold war” and “war on terror” and a perpetual standing army to treat the unsolved problem of a lingering threat. It’s not clear that this increase in government power was a good thing.<p>Secondly, the idea that “we” (government) “know” the answers is hubris. The author claims that “we” know it would be good to send everyone to college for free, but is that actually best for everyone? Or does that just turn college to more high school, lower the quality of education, waste a lot of people’s time, slow down the creation of families and negatively impinge on demographic trends, etc? “Knowing” the solution presupposes knowledge of second-order effects, and people are generally very bad at that. Thinking that a total state “knows” the best solutions to problems is a good way to impose lots of (potentially negative) second-order effects without much recourse to do anything about it, since this total state has all the authority and no longer has competing authorities to check its hubris.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38838745" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38838745" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bruce511</span><span>|</span><a href="#38838670">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38838979">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38838691">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38838745">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38838745">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I hear your point - if humans are part of the problem then an effective solution has to allow for humans in the loop.<p>I&#x27;d extend that thought to be more narrow though.

Which might be a bad thing in this case, but to me it is much less insane than becoming a hermit over something that is objectively not an actual danger to them anymore, unless they believe their 5 boosters don&#x27;t help. So I&#x27;m not sure that reducing it to caring or not is actually helpful. You can care about something but disagree about the method.<p>I guess my point is that I don&#x27;t think antivaxxers don&#x27;t believe in vaccines because they just want people to die, they don&#x27;t believe in vaccines because they think it doesn&#x27;t help people from dying. They <i>actually</i> believe vaccines don&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s not just pretend play. It&#x27;s very very dumb, but I don&#x27;t think that framing as is just not caring until stuff happens to them is helpful.<p>If you didn&#x27;t believe that for example, homeopathy works, you won&#x27;t suddenly think that it should be used if someone close to you dies. Maybe in desperation, but that&#x27;s different from believing it. Obviously the difference is that homeopathy doesn&#x27;t work, and vaccines absolutely do. But remember, that&#x27;s literally what antivaxxers disagree with!</div><br/><div id="38839550" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38839550" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xboxnolifes</span><span>|</span><a href="#38838477">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38838904">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38838845">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38839550">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38839550">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; That&#x27;s funny, the people who are dumb and emotional in my entourage are those who are still completely afraid of COVID even after like, 5 boosters, even if they are in their thirties<p>I have a few friends like this, though to a lesser degree as their worries have disappeared by now.<p>&gt; I guess my point is that I don&#x27;t think antivaxxers don&#x27;t believe in vaccines because they just want people to die, they don&#x27;t believe in vaccines because they think it doesn&#x27;t help people from dying.

It more subtle than that. And what I said was not supposed to be a generalization at all. It was <i>specifically</i> about my family members.<p>I do think <i>some portion</i> of all people fall into this group though. Yes, they might truly believe the covid vaccines do more harm than good. But also yes, they would immediately line-up for a covid vaccine if a close family member became hospitalized and visually looked bad. Nothing about the dangers of the vaccine changes in this scenario, and covid didn&#x27;t suddenly become more dangerous to them. It just became more emotionally <i>visceral</i>. That&#x27;s not desperation. It&#x27;s straightforward emotional persuasion, and is the &quot;feeling the pain&quot; as originally commented about.<p>I do think there is many more social dynamics at play, but I don&#x27;t feel confident in articulating my scattered thoughts on them well. How people adjust how they act based on social groups, or with very little information people form very strong opinions, how information bubbles impact what topics you see or how they&#x27;re presented, etc.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38838845" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38838845" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">speedgoose</span><span>|</span><a href="#38838477">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38838522">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38838904">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38838555">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38838845">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38838845">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A family member died from Covid-19, and another family member stayed against vaccine and social distancing.

That is: given a choice between a course of action that will make capitalism seem like the only possible economic system, and one that will make capitalism actually be a more viable long-term economic system, neoliberalism has meant always choosing the former.&quot;<p>&gt; [...]<p>&gt; &quot;If the ultimate aim of neoliberal capitalism is to create a world where no one believes any other economic system could really work, then it needs to suppress not just any idea of an inevitable redemptive future, but really any radically different technological future at all. There’s a kind of contradiction here. It cannot mean convincing us that technological change has come to an end—since that would mean capitalism is not really progressive. It means convincing us that technological progress is indeed continuing, that we do live in a world of wonders, but to ensure those wonders largely take the form of modest improvements (the latest iPhone!), rumors of inventions about to happen (“I hear they actually are going to have flying cars pretty soon”), even more complex ways of juggling information and imagery, and even more complex platforms for the filling out of forms.&quot;<p>The system we are in is inert and we need more than ranked voting to fix it.</div><br/><div id="38838636" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38838636" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">panick21_</span><span>|</span><a href="#38838552">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38838541">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38838636">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38838636">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That one of the dumbest things I have recently heard, and that by David Graebers amazing standard of saying nonsense.</div><br/><div id="38838680" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38838680" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nmilo</span><span>|</span><a href="#38838552">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38838636">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38838541">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38838680">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38838680">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">How so?</div><br/><div id="38839274" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38839274" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">panick21_</span><span>|</span><a href="#38838552">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38838680">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38838541">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38839274">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38839274">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">First of all, I don&#x27;t actually think the argument is even very coherent. So lets break it down as far as I can understand.<p>As background I would argue leftist in the 1970s created &#x27;neoliberalism&#x27;, its not and never was a coherent framework of policy proposed or defended by anybody. What it was is simply a framework for leftists to throw literally anybody that doesn&#x27;t agree with them (outside of leftist anarchists) into that bucket.<p>The function was to simply group all opposing view points under one umbrella to have a unified attack vector.<p>Somehow extreme free market people, social democrats and social conservatives are under one umbrella and somehow together have organized a global conspiracy to defend this supposed philosophy.<p>Swedish policy makers who wanted to reduce government share of GDP from 60% to 50% are just evil Friedman loving market fundamentalists. Neoliberals want to somehow reduce governments but also want military to globally enforce neoliberal hegemony. Of course, that makes total sense. Or it maybe just could be that we are talking about lots and lots of different groups with fundamentally different points of view.<p>&gt; If the ultimate aim of neoliberal capitalism is to create a world where no one believes any other economic system could really work<p>This just fundamentally makes no sense, &#x27;neoliberal capitalism&#x27; does not have any opinions. There isn&#x27;t even a clear organization that represent &#x27;neoliberalism&#x27;.<p>So somehow what he is saying here is that all the people who &#x27;believe&#x27; in neolibearlism somehow have convinced themselves that their live goal should be &#x27;creating a world where no one believes in alternatives&#x27;.<p>The idea that all those supposed neoliberals somehow have a coherent program of eliminating alternatives is ridiculous.<p>Politicians don&#x27;t want to successfully solve problems and get reelected in a land-slide victory, they much rather lose but preserve neoliberal world order. Anybody that believes this is actually delusional.<p>The reality is solving problems is actually hard.

And most of the problems aren&#x27;t hard because of some neoliberal conspiracy against progress but because they politically hard and even if you can get politics to somewhat line up, actual execution is also very hard. See California High Speed Rail for example.<p>&gt; but really any radically different technological future at all<p>Ok, so neoliberalism is somehow preventing technological improvements, if I understand that correctly. I guess one can make that argument, but I would like some actual facts and examples. Because I don&#x27;t see it.<p>Countries that are very neoliberal in global comparison have gone in very different direction. The Netherlands, inventor of modern capitalism, is revolutionizing transport thanks to the humble bike.<p>Switzerland, has fundamentally changed its rail transportation system and massively increased rail modal share. They built the largest tunnel in the world to protect the Alps from to much trucking.<p>Japan has people travel even more by rail and they are even building a crazy high speed maglev.<p>If you look at the US, Netherlands, Switzerland and Japan, you see radically different conception of the future of transport. But these countries are all some form of neoliberal.<p>What amazing transport technology is &#x27;neoliberalism&#x27; preventing from taking over? What path of technology is prevented by being &#x27;neoliberal&#x27;.<p>&gt;  It cannot mean convincing us that technological change has come to an end—since that would mean capitalism is not really progressive.<p>And &#x27;it&#x27; (again not a thing) wouldn&#x27;t want to ...<p>&gt; It means convincing us that technological progress is indeed continuing, that we do live in a world of wonders, but to ensure those wonders largely take the form of modest improvements (the latest iPhone!), rumors of inventions about to happen (“I hear they actually are going to have flying cars pretty soon”), even more complex ways of juggling information and imagery, and even more complex platforms for the filling out of forms.<p>Again, there is no substance to this. Its in the nature of semiconductors that it can evolve faster then say massive rail infrastructure. To simply dismiss all progress in computing as somehow irrelevant is absurd. Improvements in software, sensors and data is what makes so many other things possible, modern manufacturing, modern research and development wouldn&#x27;t be the same without it. His casual divisiveness about computation as trivial is simply idiotic.<p>But its hard to argue with him since he provides no counter argument at any kind, just some vague assertion that (a) neoliberalism is a dominate ideology (b) technological progress is slow.<p>If we look at most machines, efficiency is rising continuously. New EMU trains and electric lokos are more efficient, new passenger planes are significantly more efficient, rocket technology has improved by a huge margin, electric cars have unprecedented growth, electric bikes are revolutionary. I could go on.<p>At the same time, as I have demonstrated above, countries are doing revolutionary things even with existing technology. The bike hasn&#x27;t gotten better, but the Dutch have revolutionized transport anyway.<p>He needs to demonstrate that technology is failing us to actually make this argument.<p>&gt; (“I hear they actually are going to have flying cars pretty soon”)<p>The obsession with flying cars is a US obsession that is not talked about much here in Switzerland where I live. Instead we are in process of talking about Rail 2050 project and how it should look. Rail 2035 project is ongoing.<p>The US has built itself into a car depended hellhole and the flying car is the only solution a car dependent nation can figure out. I guess for David this is also neoliberals fault, despite many other nations who are also &#x27;neoliberal&#x27; according to him not having the same issues.<p>And of course the obsession with the car is something that actual classical liberals never would have wanted. National highway program is a gigantic ongoing infrastructure project. A massive book of regulation about road building that encodes all the worst design principles in law and makes it impossible to build modern advanced infrastructure.  Governments that use state power to take over private property and put highways threw that land. I guess that neoliberalism as well?<p>I have not read this new book (and wont) but from what is written here it seems to me that he believes:<p>- Neoliberalism is a coherent philosophy --&gt; It isn&#x27;t.<p>- Assuming it &#x27;was&#x27; an actual philosophy, its core tenant is the suppression of alternatives --&gt; It wouldn&#x27;t be. And even if it was, it couldn&#x27;t successfully do so.<p>- Neoliberalism defenders accept personal failure to preserve the NWO (Neoliberal World Order) --&gt; They don&#x27;t.<p>- Neoliberalism prevents &#x27;real&#x27; technological improvement --&gt; It isn&#x27;t.<p>- Neoliberalism prevents solving &#x27;real&#x27; problems -&gt; It isn&#x27;t since it isn&#x27;t a dominant philosophy to begin with.<p>To some it up, David Graeber is the &#x27;perfect&#x27; leftist intellectual. Never clearly define your own own position and clearly state what and how things should be done instead but still strongly imply that it would be utterly amazing. Spread a bunch of vague smart sounding criticism about societies big evils (&lt;insert thing here&gt; capitalism). Throw some hand selected historical examples with health dose of historical revisionist takes. Throw in a strong dose of &#x27;other intellectuals that don&#x27;t agree with me are capitalist shills&#x27;. And there you have a great leftist table top book.<p>Reading people like him rather then people who actually have real knowlage about the current situation and propose actual real solutions or at least processes that could be put into place to help real solution from existing are what is actually needed to make progress.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="38838541" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38838541" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bbor</span><span>|</span><a href="#38838552">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38838966">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38838541">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38838541">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Great article, but it feels a bit absurd to not mention the clear, obvious cause of all this: wealth inequality and corporate governmental capture because of capitalism.

This was the age of High Modernism, with all of its planned cities and collective farms and so on. Philosopher-bureaucrat-scientist-dictator-manager-kings would lead the way to a new era of gleaming steel towers, where society was managed with the same ease as a gardener pruning a hedgerow.<p>&gt; Realistically this was all a sham. Alan Greenspan had no idea how to prevent recessions, scientific progress was slowing down, poverty remained as troubling as ever, and 50% of public school students stubbornly stayed below average. But the media trusted the government, the people trusted the media, and failures got swept under the rug by genteel agreement among friendly elites, while the occasional successes were trumpeted from the rooftops.<p>&gt; In Gurri&#x27;s telling, High Modernism had always been a failure, but the government-media-academia elite axis had been strong enough to conceal it from the public. Starting in the early 2000s, that axis broke down. People could have lowered their expectations, but in the real world that wasn&#x27;t how things went. Instead of losing faith in the power of government to work miracles, people believed that government could and should be working miracles, but that the specific people in power at the time were too corrupt and stupid to press the &quot;CAUSE MIRACLE&quot; button which they definitely had and which definitely would have worked. And so the outrage, the protests - kick these losers out of power, and replace them with anybody who had the common decency to press the miracle button!<p>EDIT to be more topical to the submission:<p>&gt; So for example, Gurri examines some of the sloganeering where people complain about how eg obesity is the government&#x27;s fault - surely the government could come up with some plan that cured obesity, and since they haven&#x27;t done so, that proves they&#x27;re illegitimate and don&#x27;t care that obesity is killing millions of Americans. Or homelessness - that&#x27;s the fault of capitalism, right? Because &quot;we&quot; could just give every homeless person a home, but capitalism prevents &quot;us&quot; from doing that. Or if you&#x27;re a conservative, how come the government hasn&#x27;t forced the liberal rot out of schools and made everybody pious and patriotic and family-values-having? Doesn&#x27;t that mean our lack of strong values is the government&#x27;s fault? The general formula is (1.) take vast social problem that has troubled humanity for millennia (2.) claim that theoretically The System could solve the problem, but in fact hasn&#x27;t (3.) interpret that as &quot;The System has caused the problem and it is entirely the system&#x27;s fault&quot; (4.) be outraged that The System is causing obesity and homelessness and postmodernism and homosexuality and yet some people still support it. How could they do that??!</div><br/><div id="38838688" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38838688" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">smsm42</span><span>|</span><a href="#38838608">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38838023">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38838688">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38838688">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The OP is like if High Modernism were a teenager.
