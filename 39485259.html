I&#x27;m happy OP is doing this and making noise because we can only address issues we&#x27;re aware of and that get enough traction.<p>But I find comments like these often become popular and highly upvoted because of their formulation but end up serving very little utility and ultimately dismissive. I think they&#x27;re upvoted because they are in factual and accurate, and we like the confirmation because it shows how intelligent we are. But I think they end up being dismissive because it is missing the point. It is dismissive because there are no actual points being addressed or solutions being offered. There is an implicit solution of the government generating said report, but I think this would need to be (more) explicit. It also seems that anytime these comments raise to the top that the conversations become very unorganized and off topic, because frankly there is little to go off of. If writing a purely educational response I think it is quite hard to do (and even this comment might have the same repercussions but I&#x27;m trying to add more and my intent here is to align the thread. No one need reply to my comment).<p>Personally I think a good solution would be for the law regarding these free reports should be updated to specify that they should not be a data collecting process. That they are only allowed to ask for information that they already have and that this is solely used to verify the authenticity of the user. Using this process to generate novel data is an abuse of the system. I also personally feel that the public should be able to have more recourse for mistakes that are made by these companies (within reason). I still feel like there has not been enough recourse for the Equifax breach and that not enough has been done to protect citizens. I don&#x27;t think this is an unpopular opinion, but ensuring our politicians are aligned with public beliefs is a whole other conversation.<p>[0] Personally I feel it is pretty obvious and apparent that credit agencies operate to collect and process data about people. It is then also apparent, to me, that of course the incentives align to them getting even more data about you as possible. It seems to me that anyone that is doing yearly report generating is highly likely to be aware of the business model. But not everyone is me so maybe that&#x27;s not the intent.

The rub though is they try as hard as possible to make you think you have to pay for it and every time you sign in you have to decline to pay.<p>It’s so fucked up. If we’re going to have our lives controlled by credit agencies, then individuals should be able to access their real score at any time for no cost and no bullshit.
