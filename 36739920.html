I may be misremembering the details, but the gist was that Pepsi was a bit sweeter, and so in the tiny amounts that people tasted during taste tests, they usually prefer the sweeter drink. In normal use, however, that flavor of Pepsi was too sweet, and sales tanked.<p>I see the same problem with user tests. People almost always pick the simpler of two options, because at the time they have no reason to pick anything else, and that looks easier. But then you start trying to get actual work done, and the Fisher Priced interface is too simplified.<p>And I know it&#x27;s not just you or me that prefer information dense websites. Look at how well-known McMaster&#x27;s site is, among people who actually need to use it to get work done.<p>Even in general public terms, things have gone too far. I set up a lot of iPads for elderly folks for use in assistive communication, and I have to go out of my way to use ones that have buttons. The modern ones without a home button are just too complicated for a whole swath of our population, and I am not exaggerating.</div><br/><div id="36743039" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36743039" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">alister</span><span>|</span><a href="#36741405">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36742241">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36744474">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36743039">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36743039">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>But then you start trying to get actual work done, and the Fisher Priced interface is too simplified.</i><p>That&#x27;s exactly my thinking as well. To give another example:<p>This week I tried to use an iPad and an Apple Pencil for day-to-day note taking. If you handwrite 100% plain English prose like, The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog, it instantly converts it to text and corrects any typos. For simple stuff, it seems perfect.<p>But it&#x27;s insufferable once you start on real work. It doesn&#x27;t understand a lot of punctuation, tries to correct foreign words (likes names and locations) I mix in with English, tries to spell correct serial numbers (N07 becomes NOT). Having to go back and correct each conversion error turned out to be much slower -- and frustrating.

The old one ran on some Unix iirc, had a text mode interface, and was entirely controlled by keyboard. Staff could use it in their sleep, enter text, tab, enter more text, tab tab, and so on.<p>The new version ran on Windows, had a lot more features for sure, but suddenly staff was entering data into a field, grabbed the mouse to move to the next field, entered data, and so on. The process became way slower. So I asked why they don&#x27;t just ignore the mouse and keep using tab. They were surprised this even works, because it was never mentioned by the folks who trained them on the new software. It was all about how modern and slick it looks and how it has so many more features.<p>So then staff tried to use the tab key again, but got frustrated very quickly since the software was smart enough so enable and disable controls in the entry form depending on selections you made in earlier fields. So tabbing through the form would require different number of key presses all the time, making it hard to build muscle memory. I think they raised their complaints to management but whether that feedback ever reached the software vendor I have no idea. I guess they did get faster again over time because any new system takes time to get used to, but I&#x27;d be very surprised if it ever matched the ancient, simple system again.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36744477" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36744477" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">alex-moon</span><span>|</span><a href="#36741405">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36743039">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36744757">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36744226">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36744477">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36744477">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This explains a tendency I&#x27;ve long had which I always assumed was just a look and feel thing.

I do think there is an issue with the walled gardens, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the people who use them. It&#x27;s the psychological effect of having affirmation systems tied to everything you post. I&#x27;m sure most people would post waaaaaaaay less &quot;uninteresting&quot; content if it wasn&#x27;t because of the dopamine chase. I&#x27;m guilty of it myself. I try to ask myself if I&#x27;m really trying to contribute or if I&#x27;m just posting to get likes, and sometimes it prevents me from posting things to social media sites. There are a lot of time where it doesn&#x27;t though. You may not put much value in Reddits karma system, but what value do you put into your hacker news account? I know from my own experience that it&#x27;s been fairly healthy for me to create a new account every time I reach a 1000 points. I hope that I&#x27;ll eventually get to the point where I don&#x27;t have to do that, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m there yet.<p>It&#x27;s obviously up to you, but I&#x27;d encourage you to not so blatantly disregard other people for what they post on social media.

MSM is society-level technology and it&#x27;s clearly doing something to it that would not have happened in its  absence.<p>I&#x27;m seeing it in personal acquaintances, who get lost in the information garbage sphere and struggle to contextualize the places that unfavorably shape their belief system (not talking about niche crackpot sites, but trash media here).<p>This is the polar opposite of what I had hoped would happen with this technology before it got captured by economic incentives. And it&#x27;s also not what would have happened, had this mold not proliferated, and slower but curated systems prevailed.<p>It&#x27;s not all terrible, there&#x27;s resilience and adaptation. And yet I cannot stop feeling we&#x27;re dealing with a quite unwelcome phenomenon that weakens a sizable part of us who would profit from a more controlled information environment the most (the dumb get dumber, the smart get smarter, and everyone gets more distracted and fickle).</div><br/><div id="36741872" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36741872" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mulmen</span><span>|</span><a href="#36740666">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36741777">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36741868">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36741872">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36741872">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What do you mean by MSM?

Then there was Web 2.0. Now we find ourselves in the era of Web Pi (3.14159). This humorous term comes from one of my favourite comments that I once found on HN. Quoting the comment from &lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30139081">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30139081</a>&gt; below:<p>&gt; <i>Nice read. Firm supporter of Web Pi (3.1415). When it comes to building for the web today, I&#x27;m always amazed that &quot;so much can be done with so little&quot; and yet the default is the opposite - &quot;so much is needed to deliver so little&quot; - so irrational! Where did we go wrong? I wonder what Web Euler (2.71828) would have looked like?</i><p>In that same thread, I made a comment that my favourite phase of the web was Web Golden (1.61803). That was my attempt at extending their humour. Web Golden refers to the very short-lived sweet spot between Web 1.0 and Web 2.0. If you&#x27;re looking for a moderate dose of nostalgia, I have elaborated that golden phase a little more in my blog post here: &lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;susam.net&#x2F;maze&#x2F;web-golden.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;susam.net&#x2F;maze&#x2F;web-golden.html</a>&gt;.<p>By the way, the Wiby link on this HN story took me to this website: &lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.evanmiller.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.evanmiller.org&#x2F;</a>&gt;.
