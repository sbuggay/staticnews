Stoll always struck me as nothing more than an opportunist with little actual technical acumen who happened to be in the right place (a university computer lab) at the right time (dark ages of computer security, and the last decade of the cold war). At best he was a siren, being one of the first to sound the alarm about the importance of security, but he could hardly do anything to actually prevent the unauthorized accesses he dramatized, and I wonder if he even would have discovered them had his adversaries cared more.</div><br/><div id="39848487" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39848487" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vintagedave</span><span>|</span><a href="#39844927">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39847429">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39848383">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39848487">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39848487">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">From the HN guidelines: &quot;be kind.&quot; I do not think your comment fits that _at all_.<p>My converse opinion: Dr Stoll is an extraordinarily humble, kind, and enthusiastic person who I&#x27;ve only ever interacted with online, but found to be one of the best human beings on the planet.<p>There&#x27;s extraordinary value in being smart, dedicated, and in the right place at the right time. He was all three. His book, I think, definitely recognises the role both luck and determination played.<p>As for the web being nirvana... ten years ago, I would have thought he was overly pessimistic. (And many luminaries have written things about the future that were not accurate: even Bill Gates wrote books that have IMO not aged well.) But now, in 2024? I feel he was not a &quot;siren&quot; but a &quot;python&quot;: an oracle a quarter century ahead of his time.

Computers have still not successfully replaced teachers.
Computers have still not changed the way government works.<p>Computer technology has undoubtedly had enormous effects on many aspects of society but it has failed to produce benefits that many early technology idealists and entrepreneurs predicted, and it has made some things a lot worse.<p>We have lost the quality journalism that was nurtured by the old broadsheet newspapers because they no longer have the necessary money nor inclination to do it.<p>Education systems are in decline everywhere. Teacher quality has declined.  The best teachers find jobs outside the education systems.  Student performance has declined despite vast investments in technology for education. Student attention spans have declined and mental health problems have greatly increased along with increased exposure to technology.<p>Governments at least have benefited from technology in that has enabled mass  surveillance and control of their citizens.  But other areas of government administration for public benefit, such as health administration and education have not improved. Yet governments have wasted vast amounts of taxpayer money in failed technology projects.  Wider citizen participation in democracy? Not so much.<p>What Cliff Stoll seems to have underestimated is people&#x27;s willingness to put up with cheaper, lower-quality technological alternatives to quality newspapers, good teachers and public administration.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39847930" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39847930" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mendelab</span><span>|</span><a href="#39844927">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39847429">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39848383">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39847573">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39847930">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39847930">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Are you laughing because we lost most newspapers to garbage online news, because schools are digitalized with no benefits, because social media made us less democratic, or because fake products are sold on the most successful online stores?<p>For sure he underestimated the impact, but he was not &#x2F;wrong&#x2F;.

His premise was that only those who were working for the government or working on real computers at big companies should be trusted with their immense power. And this was sort of a second act to try to keep being invited on to TV shows or something.
