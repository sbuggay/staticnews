It doesn&#x27;t matter if the proposal is a public healthcare system or a market system with actual price transparency or something else entirely, until you can overcome the political inertia of the incumbent system.<p>And these feed into each other.

Very many great works of culture, philosophy and history are little read by the standards of social media.   I have no idea why you think that means they &#x27;don&#x27;t shape the culture&#x27;. I doubt that, each year, Wittgenstein&#x27;s Philosophical Investigations is read even one hundredth the number of times that Mr Beast&#x27;s videos are watched. I very much doubt that the future historian will take the Philosophical Investigations - by consensus the most influential work of philosophy in the twentieth century, whose effects on our intellectual culture are deep and pervasive - to be an incidental footnote when compared to Mr Beast.<p>But cultural value isn&#x27;t just a function of influence, clearly. Knausgaard&#x27;s books are to many people, myself included, simply great works of art, and should be celebrated for that fact.
