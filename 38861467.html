You can be _great_ at only a couple things. And you can only be the _best_ at a single thing. As it happens, I think you can actually be fairly good at _many_ things, which is something I am trying to achieve for myself.<p>Of course, you need not to be too competitive or perfectionist, but you can then enjoy lots of great things on this planet, while benefiting from the compounding interests of transferring what you learn in one discipline to another.<p>I play the trumpet at a fairly good level, I am a decent road and mountain biker, I have enough knowledge of mountaineering to plan and lead simple ascents in the alps, I have a PhD in computer science and I consider myself a decent software developper, I have a baby and a beautiful wife, I have enough depth in physics and philosophy to have an interesting chat with majors of these disciplines.<p>However, I had to give up on being truly great at any of these things. Yet, I found that you can then draw some fascinating parallels between brass playing and biking, physics and computer science, mountaineering and having a family.<p>So, yes, you need to know what to focus on, but your focus can definitely be on striking the very delicate balance that allows you to be &#x27;just good&#x27; at lots of things.</div><br/><div id="38864606" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38864606" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kqr</span><span>|</span><a href="#38864581">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38862167">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38864606">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38864606">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Highly related: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;danluu.com&#x2F;p95-skill&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;danluu.com&#x2F;p95-skill&#x2F;</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38862167" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38862167" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nate</span><span>|</span><a href="#38864581">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38863505">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38862167">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38862167">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve enjoyed Ali Abdaal&#x27;s new book he just launched.

The goal is to find out where in the world I want to move and work, to meet new friends, to make art, and to dance as much as I can.<p>At this stage, in the jargon of the blog post, you might say that I am rather explorative. I made this plan after my old job became unbearable, and at the same time a lot of my friends started to leave town, and also my apartment&#x27;s contract was coming to an end. Seemed like an opportune moment to do something so crazy.<p>While packing my stuff I took the time to organize all the old papers I&#x27;d shoved away in a closet, including old notebooks and drawings all the way back to kindergarten. In the process, it became clear to me how far I had strayed from the strengths, passions, and hopes of that small boy I used to be.<p>Tango totally blindsided me a-year-and-a-half ago. I always dreaded dancing, feared it, but decided to join some friends attending a beginners class. The payout on that unlikely arm of the bandit has been absolutely staggaring. So, while quite exploratory, my journey will be exploitative as well.<p>I still have left room for more kinds of discoveries. I have vague plans of drawing, writing poetry, writing a blog and publishing videos, learning new programming languages, and more. I definitely will be bringing my guitar, but after reading this blog post I am asking myself whether the smart thing to do would be to narrow down my options at some early stage of the journey, and even throughout it, honing in on just a couple of the things I want to do, if not just one.<p>The idea of limiting myself is both unsettling and yet also relieving. I already feel like I know the order in which I will cut off the arms of the bandit. And if I&#x27;m lucky, it won&#x27;t simply turn into a Hydra!</div><br/><div id="38864370" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38864370" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">svilen_dobrev</span><span>|</span><a href="#38863505">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38864424">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38864370">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38864370">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">good on yer. i am envious. but don&#x27;t limit yourself to Evropa (hint hint).

I&#x27;d love to completely deprioritize the following roles, but they don&#x27;t seem to want to detach themselves from me: tech support geek for wifi and computer issues, bookkeeper and tax preparer working hand-in-hand with my accountant, occasionally car expert for buying and maintaining vehicles, real estate expert for evaluating house purchases based on market conditions and my families needs, health care plan decider, and on and on and on.

Could you get the absolutely best house for the best price? Yeah. Is it worth the trade-off of your other focus? Probably not.<p>There&#x27;s no need for you to be a master mechanic, you just need to be good enough.
