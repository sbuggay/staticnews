Hence articles about species and populated places are generally not deleted, even if the topic is only weakly sourced<p>This is not why this happens on Wikipedia; sourcing is a factor, but notability derived from the nature and quality of the cited sources is the most commonly used criteria to delete articles.<p>For example, Wikipedia once had a notability guideline that a person who completed in a sport at the international level was probably notable, so a weakly sourced article on, say, a footballer with a single international cap could be notable enough to avoid deletion.<p>But then editors removed this guideline and fell back onto the general notability guideline (GNG), which is much stricter for people: substantial biographical coverage from reliable mainstream sources at the national level. Match reports don&#x27;t count (too routine), no local interviews (too primary), no enthusiast publications (not reliable enough), etc.<p>Of course, this meant that hundreds of stubs and dozens of full articles about women&#x27;s international footballers would never meet GNG due to a relative lack of mainstream media coverage, even if they won a World Cup. So all it took was one editor to decide to do almost nothing but flag hundreds such articles since the opening of the Women&#x27;s World Cup this summer, almost all of which were deleted.<p>So it&#x27;s not this reason that keeps moths and places:<p>&gt; On the other hand, no-one has yet come up with a way to monetize a topic like Pseudoneuroterus mazandarani or use it to push a contentious point of view.<p>But rather, very different standards of notability are why there are more low-traffic articles on items and places that can&#x27;t sue Wikipedia editors for libel.</div><br/><div id="37958120" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37958120" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wavemode</span><span>|</span><a href="#37957549">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37957850">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37958120">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37958120">[18 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s really funny - just this morning I was reading the Wikipedia article for Interstate 94, which led me to the WikiProject that maintains it (US Roads) and an open letter they wrote a month ago that they were leaving Wikipedia and starting their own wiki, because of how painful it&#x27;s been having their articles deleted due to arbitrary notability guidelines.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikipedia:WikiProject_U.S._Roads&#x2F;Newsletter&#x2F;Issues&#x2F;Volume10&#x2F;Issue01" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikipedia:WikiProject_U.S._Roa...</a></div><br/><div id="37958627" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37958627" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">starkparker</span><span>|</span><a href="#37957549">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37958120">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37959022">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37958627">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37958627">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A couple points on their complaints: you _can_ cite primary sources, but you can&#x27;t _rely_ on them.

The potential is there.<p>It&#x27;s often a bad thing in practice, much like how splitting off entirely separate social networks for specific subjects is often a bad idea. If there aren&#x27;t enough people or activity, interest wanes. If the project relies on one or two heavily active editors, it collapses when they&#x27;re unavailable. If you never hit critical mass for SEO or can&#x27;t&#x2F;don&#x27;t know how to promote your content, all the work is done in a vacuum and everyone sees the Wikipedia stubs over your stuff anyway.<p>Fandom (as in the company), as awful as it is, largely exists by virtue of participation in the subjects where there&#x27;s enough interest to facilitate it; the mass wiki-farm infrastructure gives them enough of a SEO boost to dominate even some of the wikis that fork off of Fandom to escape its policies.<p>&gt; you can always import back the articles into Wikipedia. So maybe it can be a useful way for communities to &quot;incubate&quot; articles?<p>Developing an article on a separate wiki has additional technical and administrative overhead.<p>CC BY-SA requires attribution. Wikipedia attributes contributions by article history. The only way to import article history is via Special:Import. You have to be an admin or have import rights to use Special:Import on Wikipedia.<p>If you can clear all those hurdles, then in theory you can import changes with the required attribution from another wiki. But if the imported changes conflict with changes made in parallel on Wikipedia, resolving them can be very contentious, especially if any of the editors involved disagree on the resolution. Or the import might fail, because Special:Import isn&#x27;t particularly robust.<p>And as the forked wiki admin, do you decide to set up scheduled imports _from_ Wikipedia to keep up with upstream? These forks often split because Wikipedia is deficient in some way beyond just editing the text. AARoads&#x27; fork&#x27;s use of improved maps, for instance, would probably break the article on Special:Import because it looks like they use different wiki templates and modules.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37963564" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37963564" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">riwsky</span><span>|</span><a href="#37957549">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37958120">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37959022">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37957850">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37963564">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37963564">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Roads fork?

MySQL simply isn&#x27;t built for picking a truly random row performantly (I&#x27;m not sure if any of the common relational databases are?).<p>If you do something naive like &quot;ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 1&quot; performance is worse than abysmal. Similarly, doing a &quot;LIMIT 0 OFFSET RAND() * row_count&quot; is comparably abysmal. While if you do something performant like &quot;WHERE id &gt;= RAND() * max_id ORDER BY id LIMIT 1&quot;, you encounter the same problem where the id gaps in deleted articles make certain articles more likely to be chosen.<p>There are only two &quot;correct&quot; solutions. The first is to pick id&#x27;s at random and then retry when an id isn&#x27;t a valid article, but the worry here is with how sparse the id&#x27;s might be, and the fact it might have to occasionally retry 20 times -- unpredictable performance characteristics like that aren&#x27;t ideal. While the second is to maintain a separate column&#x2F;table that includes all valid articles in a sequential integer sequence, and then pick a random integer guaranteed to be valid. But the problem with performance is now that every time you delete an article, you have to recalculate and rewrite, on average, half the entire column of integers.<p>So for something that&#x27;s really just a toy feature, the way Wikipedia implements it is kind of &quot;good enough&quot;. And downsides could be mitigated by recalculating each article&#x27;s random number every so often, e.g. as a daily or weekly or slowly-but-constantly-crawling batch job, or every time a page gets edited.<p>You could also dramatically improve it (but without making it quite perfect) by using the process as it exists, but rather than picking the article with the closest random number, select the ~50 immediately lower and higher than it, and then pick randomly from those ~100. It&#x27;s a complete and total hack, but in practice it&#x27;ll still be extremely performant.</div><br/><div id="37958247" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37958247" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">munificent</span><span>|</span><a href="#37956486">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37957518">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37958970">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37958247">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37958247">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If it were up to me, I&#x27;d implement something sort of like an online[0] Fisher-Yates shuffle:<p>Add a column to the article database for &quot;random_index&quot;.

To pick a random article, just pick a random number in that range using your favorite random number generator and then look up the row with that random_index value.<p>The tricky part, obviously, is maintaining the invariant that random index values are (1) randomly assigned and (2) contiguous. To maintain those, I believe it&#x27;s enough to:<p>1. Whenever a new article is created, give it random_index N+1. Then choose a random number in the range (1, N+1). Swap the random_index of the new article and the article whose random_index is the number you just rolled. This is the Fisher-Yates step that gives you property (1).<p>2. Whenever an article is deleted or otherwise removed from the set of articles that can be randomly selected, look up the article with random_index N.

I&#x27;m suggesting that before Wikipedia, no encyclopedia could have published an article about Jack Wade, Alaska, an incorporated community of probably &lt; 100 people (I picked this place somewhat randomly off of google maps). If you put even one sentence about every town similar to that in an encyclopedia, you&#x27;d have an encyclopedia set that no one would be able to afford.<p>&gt; What we&#x27;d then have is a social network of people competing for some kind of points or popularity, or to prove who was the most expert or most interested in the subject.<p>This really depends. For example, maybe I&#x27;m an American with a grandparent from Volosianka, Lviv Oblast, Ukraine (again, I picked this semi-randomly). Population is about 1500 today. There&#x27;s probably a handful of people in the world who speak English and who have a particular interest in that town. Maybe my grandpa is from there and i&#x27;m looking to learn more about his life and i&#x27;d love to chat with someone else who knows more about the place. I think that there are a lot of articles on the long tail of wikipedia where there&#x27;s probably only a few people in the world who care about the topic and if I&#x27;m one of them, I&#x27;d be interested in meeting with others. Obviously, there&#x27;s plenty of topics where this isn&#x27;t the case. I don&#x27;t know how you&#x27;d implement this feature, because I don&#x27;t think you want to turn wikipedia into a meeting room for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict [1].

And yeah it&#x27;s a really annoying thing when you don&#x27;t get recognized for the hard work put into creating a draft like this. When I&#x27;m back at my computer maybe I&#x27;ll take a look and see how I can help improve your draft.<p>Generally the hardest and most annoying part about a case like this is wikipedia&#x27;s desire for reliable sources which generally means newspapers or academic sources. You can have something super well known, around forever, and often mentioned but it can be hard to find sources writing about it directly. For example, I wrote the Wikipedia article for high touch (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;High-touch" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;High-touch</a>) and it was quite annoying to try to find sources. Similarly I wrote one for &quot;smell training&quot; (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Smell_training" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Smell_training</a>) and the requirements are even higher for anything related to medicine.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m not gonna say I advise you to do this. But if you&#x27;re really confident that the article meets the notability guidelines you can also create the article in mainspace (instead of draft). If someone tries to delete it then the guidelines are a little different (vs reviewing drafts) because they have to be sure that there aren&#x27;t sources to make it notable (not just that you didn&#x27;t use them). Often times people will actually find sources and add them to the article rather than just complain you don&#x27;t have good enough ones.<p>PS: I&#x27;m sure someone will come and explain why I&#x27;m wrong here but this has generally been my experience.</div><br/><div id="37957538" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37957538" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ghaff</span><span>|</span><a href="#37956569">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37957225">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37957270">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37957538">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37957538">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;wikipedia&#x27;s desire for reliable sources which generally means newspapers or academic sources<p>Which is one of the main ironies associated with Wikipedia notability.
