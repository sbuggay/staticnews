Managers then have to work hard, to keep motivation up and people happy. Let&#x27;s call this the &quot;supportive&quot; management style.<p>It&#x27;s also known that frustrated, unhappy workers are more likely to skip as much work as they can get away with, and do only as much as they are forced&#x2F;required to do. Managers than have to work hard to control and monitor everyone, to keep the slack to a minimum. Let&#x27;s call this the &quot;adversarial&quot; management style.<p>In one of those styles, WFH employees can be more productive, more happy, and more efficient. In the other, WFH employees can&#x27;t be monitored closely enough to keep them from slacking.<p>Some managers prefer one style over the other, and not many are able to switch styles.</div><br/><div id="35944786" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35944786" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kubb</span><span>|</span><a href="#35944741">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35944876">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35944786">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35944786">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s more about lower management becoming less needed.
