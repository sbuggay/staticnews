Does anyone pay attention to this?<p>You give a talk. People show up. They clap at the end. Does it really matter what some title on some conference website is? The communication was perhaps a bit more confusing and hectic than it should have been, but does that really matter? Is that really a big deal?<p>I don&#x27;t even understand why anyone would overly care about this in the first place, and now it&#x27;s also an example of systemic bias against black people, &quot;cruel&quot;, and &quot;heartless&quot;?<p>If the talk had been outright cancelled: sure, what would have been a right dick move. But from what I can see all that happened is that the &quot;status&quot; (that I don&#x27;t think many pay attention to) got &quot;downgraded&quot; and (maybe) moved to a different timeslot. I&#x27;m just confused why this would spark such strong reactions.</div><br/><div id="36102324" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36102324" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">samastur</span><span>|</span><a href="#36101981">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36102278">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36102324">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36102324">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I haven&#x27;t been to a conference in years because of COVID, but I&#x27;ve been to plenty mainly web and Python related before.<p>Almost all of them had keynote speakers, who received a prominent spot, usually in the morning and on multi-tier conferences the only talk scheduled at that time slot. Based on content of most of those talks the expectation was to take a wider or deeper or just different look at our fields and not mainly present a smaller idea or solution.<p>But it also doesn&#x27;t matter if you or I personally do or don&#x27;t care about distinction. There is one made clearly and as soon as it is made, there is an implicit promotion or demotion depending on which way a person is being moved and one should have very good reasons to demote anyone publicly as they did here.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36102278" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36102278" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">OJFord</span><span>|</span><a href="#36101981">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36102324">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36102171">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36102278">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36102278">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You&#x27;ve been to more than me then so what am I talking about, but I always understood it to be the <i>one</i> talk given to kick things off or maybe conclude, i.e. nothing else is going on at the same time, &#x27;everyone&#x27; is listening (or else skipping it).<p>Maybe it&#x27;s just been watered down to &#x27;featured&#x27;&#x2F;&#x27;sponsored&#x27;&#x2F;&#x27;recommended&#x27; talk?

Classic expectation mismatch. For reasons that are not entirely clear to me JeanHeyd assumed &quot;somebody is pulling very weird strings behind the scenes&quot;, &quot;shadowy decisions that are non-transparent&quot;, and &quot;vindictive behavior&quot;. The best explanation I can come up with for that is that this is not so much about this talk, but rather expressing general unhappiness with the Rust leadership, and this is merely the &quot;the final straw&quot;.

The lone hacker throwing tarballs -- or patches -- over the fence is dead. Open source projects now more closely resemble &quot;real world&quot; software projects: a team of engineers using collaborative tools, working toward a defined shared vision with management and oversight. Major projects no longer follow the BDFL model, instead using incorporated entities like the Linux Foundation to direct development replete with boards and committees, leading to more &quot;office politics&quot; in how major decisions get made. A tradeoff for the greater continuity and community input a foundation provides.<p>2) Open source is more diverse than ever before, and becoming more so. More diversity means more perspectives coming to the table.<p>3) Fully 25% of Gen Z identify as LGBTQ. Among hackers that number is higher; it&#x27;s likely a <i>majority</i> of late Gen Y or Gen Z hackers are queer. And a significant fraction -- again, perhaps even larger than previous generations -- are neurodiverse. With these identities comes greater awareness of intersectional issues, and greater awareness of oneself as a member of  certain classes. Pretending that this is irrelevant to software work -- hsistorically, predominantly a white male dominated pursuit -- is a fool&#x27;s game. There are going to be struggles and clashes as members of different classes assert their grievances and call each other out.<p>In short, this kind of &quot;drama&quot; is a growing pain of open source becoming a real <i>movement</i> that invites and incorporates diverse voices. We&#x27;ll muddle through it and move on.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36101734" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36101734" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mtzet</span><span>|</span><a href="#36101718">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36102245">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36101734">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36101734">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; as best as I understand it, because of the content of JeanHeyd&#x27;s blog post on reflection in Rust.<p>I&#x27;m having trouble finding it.
