There&#x27;s 300 million Americans who will live on average 15 years in retirement, currently at an average retirement income of $75k. So this group will be spending about $1 million in retirement per person, so for 300 million Americans you&#x27;re talking about 300 trillion in spending during their retirement.<p>Now you take the most wealthy and successful corporation in the history of mankind, Apple, take its cash reserves (250 billion), subtract its debt (100 billion), and tax it (e.g. 10%) and you&#x27;re left with 15 billion, which gives you the fraction 0.00005 of the 300 trillion you&#x27;ll want to raise for US retirement of everyone alive in the US today. So in actuality you&#x27;d need to have another 20 thousand Apples, and you&#x27;d get to your number, just for the US population.<p>Ignore of course the rest of the 97% of the world population, despite Apple having earned its cash reserves from its global business, they&#x27;ll need to find their own first-in-class corporate behemoth to tax for their retirement.<p>----<p>I think more importantly, you have to acknowledge that money is just a tool for expressing value, but fundamentally has no value. What does have value is actual production. Everything that the people of the Earth can produce in a given year, and consume in a given year, constitutes their wealth. The more people work &amp; produce, the richer we are, in total. Apple could have 1 quadrillion in cash, if nobody on the planet is working, Apple and everyone else is extremely poor. Retiring simply means: you do not produce, but you do consume what others produce. And that&#x27;s fine if it&#x27;s sufficiently balanced, where the working produce sufficiently for their and the non-working&#x27;s consumption. And in France it was extremely clear from all studies that this condition wasn&#x27;t going to be met the coming decades. Raising money through taxes doesn&#x27;t change that fundamental truth, that this system is only sustainable if it is balanced, and it wasn&#x27;t.<p>To simplify it, if every working person produces 2 loafs of bread, and every person eats 1 loaf of bread per day, in a population of 10 people you need 5 to be working, and 5 can retire. 10 loafs are produced, and 10 loafs are consumed.<p>If the retirement age is low enough that 3 people work and 7 retire, you&#x27;d produce 6 loafs, but the population still needs 10 loafs to consume.<p>Taxing companies in this population to finance this earlier retirement age, just puts money in the hands of the 7. It doesn&#x27;t change the fundamental issue, which is that there&#x27;s 6 loafs of production and 10 are necessary. So you&#x27;ll see rapid inflation, bread becoming very expensive, some working and some retirees having no bread, in other words, poverty, versus the situation where the retirement age was a bit higher and all demand was being met by supply.<p>Of course actual economic models are way more complex, but this example illustrates: it&#x27;s not money, or taxes, that constitutes or generates wealth, it&#x27;s just a unit of account. What makes us wealthy is that which we produce. And human activity (= work) is the engine of that production. Reducing the retirement age = less human activity = less work = less production = less wealth. You can put taxes at any level, but that remains true. And France chose heed this rule, because all actuarial &amp; demographic tables showed it can&#x27;t sustain the wealth with the growing number of retirees, lower number of working age population, and growing life expectancy, at the old retirement age.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36823836" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36823836" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">powercf</span><span>|</span><a href="#36823134">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36823748">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36824278">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36823924">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36823836">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36823836">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If wealthy companies should pay French pensions, simply because they can, do you think that wealthy westerners should pay for, say, pensions or services in Africa?<p>Raising taxes on wealthy companies to cover pensions seems arbitrary and unfair (by which I don&#x27;t mean that taxes shouldn&#x27;t necessarily be raised).</div><br/><div id="36823899" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36823899" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">p-e-w</span><span>|</span><a href="#36823134">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36823836">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36823892">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36823899">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36823899">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; do you think that wealthy westerners should pay for, say, pensions or services in Africa?<p>If they have business interests in Africa, absolutely.<p>The world&#x27;s biggest corporations are profiting <i>massively</i> from having access to the French market.

There&#x27;s no law that requires you to work like some kind of slave. You can retire whenever you want. The laws are about the age to be eligible for full-retirement. You can already retire early and receive a lower retirement, or keep working for much longer and have a much higher income in retirement.<p>&gt; corp tax dropped from 33 to 25 in last five years<p>To drive economic growth. France&#x27;s gdp per capita is lower today than it was 15 years ago. In the US it&#x27;s 45% higher than it was 15 years ago. France&#x27;s corporate system wasn&#x27;t working, and high taxes were a key reason from lots of studies.<p>Anyway, taxes aren&#x27;t really that relevant for retirement. If a person needs to consume 10 units of goods&#x2F;services (e.g. food, clothes, healthcare, whatever), and workers produce 40 units each, a population of 25 workers can produce 1000 units and sustain another 75 retirees (1000 production, 1000 consumption).<p>If you lower the retirement age such that there are just 15 workers and 85 retirees, you&#x27;re now still consuming 1000 units, but only produce 600 units. There&#x27;s massive shortages, prices skyrocket, and many people become poor because there&#x27;s not enough production to meet their needs.<p>Raising lots of money through taxes doesn&#x27;t change this fundamental issue. Even if you give everyone $ 1 trillion dollars of money, in this economic system, there&#x27;s still not enough production to meet needs. So you need one of two things to solve it: more workers (= more production), or more productivity per worker (= more production). That latter point is not something the government can really control, although high taxes tend to drive productivity per worker down because economic activity is less rewarding to the source of the activity, as the activity is taxed. So high taxes can actually make this situation worse.<p>I&#x27;m aware I&#x27;m simplifying a lot but I hope it helps to show taxes don&#x27;t address the root-cause issue.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36824045" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36824045" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Aerroon</span><span>|</span><a href="#36823134">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36823789">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36823876">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36823552">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36824045">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36824045">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The real solution would&#x27;ve been to not create an unsustainable pyramid scheme in the first place.

  Never choose loyalty to a person over loyalty to ideas. Loyalty is the unit of corruption.
  Get directly involved in the bureaucracy and use your position to do good and stifle bad
  Use your position at work to practice professional ethics
  Get involved with a union to provide consequences via striking, show solidarity
  Get involved with investigative journalism to uncover corruption and speak truth to power
  Get involved with campaigns to get candidates you don&#x27;t believe are corrupt into positions of power
  Get a good grasp on what fighting authoritarianism with force requires and meditate deeply on the use of guillotines or analogues
  When someone else puts themselves at risk or sacrifices themselves to fight power, venerate them
  Understand that &quot;If none of us is prepared to die for freedom, then all of us will die under tyranny.&quot;
  Educate yourself on the history of revolutionary movements and try to make complex ideas simple and viral
