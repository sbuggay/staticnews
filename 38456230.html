It basically runs itself, I login to the rspamd web gui every now and then and add a few hosts to the &quot;trusted DMARC&quot; whitelist so they get a better score through rspamd, but I don&#x27;t really need to do that.<p>I&#x27;ve been running it for ~5 years this way and it hardly ever lets a spam through (Very rarely the spams that are just images get through) and I&#x27;ve rejected 2 mails that I&#x27;m fairly sure were legit (just bulk marketing ones though)<p>People always say &quot;Use Mailcow!&quot; and I say &quot;But why?&quot;.  Adding the additional complexity of docker with the random firewall rules it adds, individual containers that need to be fed and watered.  It&#x27;s a mailserver, all the processes are doing the same mail related function.

I&#x27;m not saying docker&#x2F;mailcow isn&#x27;t reliable, only that if it did break in funky ways, I don&#x27;t have the knowledge domain to fix it.  But I&#x27;m familiar with all the individual programs and running them on a &quot;flat&quot; linux system, so that&#x27;s what I did.

It also uses a hardened-malloc, Snuffleupagus (a security module for PHP), gates all PHP code behind an authentication wall (webmails), ... and does both DANE and MTA-STS validation to ensure your emails are delivered to the right place. The authentication stack handles &quot;smart&quot; rate-limiting: you get to limit the number of authentications with distinct credentials over a time-period (a misconfigured thick client won&#x27;t trigger it), you have plenty of ways to avoid running into it (application tokens for thick clients, per-device cookies that give you a way out, whitelisting of &quot;used&quot; addresses, ...) and you also get to rate limit the number of sent emails (useful if a spammer gets their hands on the credentials of one of your users)<p>On the importance of &quot;battle-testing&quot; setups: well, there are plenty of non-subtle ways of breaking an email setup. Experience has shown that all the layers in the stack can be problematic... I can give you a bunch of examples of what we ran into recently if you want.<p>On features: your setup might be simpler but your users are missing out. Whether it&#x27;s enhanced filtering (like with oletools), better indexing (full text search), indexing of attachments (with OCR! via Apache Tika), configuring server-side rules with managesieve or just &quot;having an interface&quot; to configure ooo, change their passwords, configure aliases or delegate permissions.<p>I have started spending time on Mailu because I don&#x27;t like the bloat that comes with Mailcow. Give Mailu a shot; it is reasonably easy to debug when things go wrong (and not written in PHP :p).</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38468403" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38468403" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Aachen</span><span>|</span><a href="#38466775">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38470983">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38468403">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38468403">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Spoiler: the &quot;services&quot; being &quot;explored&quot; are postfix + dovecot.

I find it analogous to, among other things, not throwing garbage on the ground: by carrying it to a trash bin, you don&#x27;t make all streets clean at once, and it may be an inconvenience, but once more people do it, streets do become cleaner. And even if others keep just dumping trash on the ground, it may be nice to know that you don&#x27;t contribute to the unpleasantness. Likewise with a multitude of other areas, including good practices in programming and administration, good manners: it is unfortunate that not everyone follows them, offsetting the effort put by those who do, but it is not necessarily a reason to give up.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38467459" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38467459" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sodality2</span><span>|</span><a href="#38466140">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38467003">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38470558">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38467449">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38467459">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38467459">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For me, it’s control over the domain.

NO issues. The biggest issue with e-mail is (in my view at least) your IP reputation. In order to ameliorate this, I simply buy colocation space, which has higher quality IPs than AWS and cloud services.<p>I&#x27;ve never had deliverability issues. Because it&#x27;s nix, upgrades are atomic. Installation is dead simple. Also, the entire setup was like two minutes. I eventually added LDAP authentication and roundcube which took some work, but because it&#x27;s nix, I did this development on a separate VM before I simply replaced my config on my main server (actually just copied the closures). Adding domains is simple: just modify the nix config file. As is adding new users. Very easy. Highly recommend to run all your critical infrastructure on Nix. Any mistakes are easy to fix... just go back to the old generation.<p>I did consider solutions like mail-in-a-box but adding the complexity and statefulness of such a system just didn&#x27;t seem worth it. Also, remote control panels scare me. My e-mail server is heavily SSH protected (Only my private key plus wireguard) and hardened against malicious IPs (fail2ban) among other things. Again, NixOS makes this easy. For storage, simple-nixos-mailserver keeps all data on a separate ZFS partition, which gets zfs &#x27;send&#x27;t to a remote backup (several).</div><br/></div></div><div id="38466848" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38466848" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Uptrenda</span><span>|</span><a href="#38467746">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38456561">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38466848">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38466848">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I remember some articles on HN a while back about running your own email servers.
