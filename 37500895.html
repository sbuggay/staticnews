I&#x27;ve been doing this for at least 15 years, and never had a negative reaction. With bank, credit card, or finance-related companies, they seem to understand immediately. With other callers I&#x27;ve gotten awkward pauses, but ultimately they were politely accommodating or at least understanding that some issue would have to be processed through other channels or postponed.<p>However, I don&#x27;t have strict requirements. When a simple callback to the support line on the card, bill, or invoice doesn&#x27;t suffice--and more often than not it does, where any support agent can field the return call by pulling up the account notes--all I ask for at most is an extension or name that I can use when calling through a published number. I&#x27;ll do all the leg work, and am actually a little more suspicious when given a specific number over the phone to then verify. Only in a few cases did I have to really dig deep into a website for a published number through which I could easily reach them. In most cases it suffices to call through a relatively well attested support number found in multiple pages or places[1].<p>I&#x27;m relatively confident that every American&#x27;s Social Security number (not to mention DoB, home address, etc) exists in at least one black market database, so my only real practical concern is avoiding scammers who can&#x27;t purchase the data at 
[black] market price, which means they&#x27;re not very sophisticated. A callback to a published phone number for an otherwise trusted entity that I already do business with suffices, IMO. And if I&#x27;m not already doing business with them, or if they have no legitimate reason to know something, they&#x27;re not getting anything, period.<p>[1] I may have even once used archive.org to verify I wasn&#x27;t pulling the number off a recently hacked page, as it was particularly off the beaten path and a direct line to the department--two qualities that deserve heightened scrutiny by my estimation.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37504863" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37504863" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">transitionnel</span><span>|</span><a href="#37502376">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37503166">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37504480">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37505256">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37504863">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37504863">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Someone needs to standardize a simple reverse-authentication system for this.<p>For example whenever a caller is requesting sensitive information, they give you a temporary extension directing to them or an equal, and ask you to call the organization&#x27;s public number and enter that extension.

It&#x27;s basically teaching people to be suspicious of any inbound requests, because in this day and age those are difficult to authenticate.<p>In other words, skip <i>all</i> the rest of &quot;security training&quot;. Only focus on &quot;hang up, look up, call back&quot;. Essentially all the rest of security training (things like keeping machines up to date, etc.) should be handled by automated policies anyway. And while I agree TOTP is and should be on its way out, the &quot;hang up, look up, call back&quot; mantra is important for requests beyond just things like securing credentials.</div><br/><div id="37503100" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37503100" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pvg</span><span>|</span><a href="#37501664">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37502299">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37503443">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37503100">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37503100">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s not just because it&#x27;s abysmal, it&#x27;s because it was found, empirically, not to work, no matter how good you make it.

Unfortunately we can’t really tell if it’s the training or if it’s the company story about all those million that got transferred out of the company when someone fell for a CEO phishing scam. I’m inclined to think it’s the latter considering how many people you can witness having the training videos run without sound (or anyone paying attention) when you walk around on the days of a new video.<p>The only way to really combat this isn’t with training and awareness it’s with better security tools.

That&#x27;s the problem hardware keys fixed, and you can fix that same problem in software.<p>† <i>(All three are closely related, and an investment you made in U2F in 2014 would still be paying off today.)</i></div><br/><div id="37504066" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37504066" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">drx</span><span>|</span><a href="#37503551">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37501827">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37504066">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37504066">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What would be your recommendation for replacing TOTP today?</div><br/><div id="37504110" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37504110" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">akerl_</span><span>|</span><a href="#37503551">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37504066">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37501827">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37504110">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37504110">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">FIDO2</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="37501827" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37501827" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">batmansmk</span><span>|</span><a href="#37503551">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37501773">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37501827">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37501827">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Are the claims of deepfake and intimate knowledge of procedures based of the sole testimony of the employee who oopsed terribly?

The fact that access to a Google account immediately gave access to all MFA tokens held within that account is the major reason why the attacker was able to get into our internal systems.<p>Google Workspace makes it very easy to set up &quot;Advanced Protection&quot; on accounts, in which case it requires using a hardware key as a second factor, instead of a phishable security code.

It used to be open source and have no connection to your Google account. Many people installed it years ago when they first set up MFA, and have just been adding stuff to it ever since because it&#x27;s easy and it works. Even for technical users who understand how TOTP works, there is no obvious reason it appears unsafe to put all your tokens in the app (until you read this article).<p>Look at the MFA help page for any website you use. One of the first sentences is probably something like &quot;First you&#x27;ll need to install a TOTP app on your phone, such as Google Authenticator or Authy...&quot;<p>It really did used to be the best option. For example, see this comment from 10 years ago when Authy first launched:<p>&gt; The Google Authenticator app is great. I recently got (TOTP) 2-factor auth for an IRC bot going with Google Authenticator; took about 5 minutes to code it up and set it up. It doesn&#x27;t use any sort of 3rd party service, just the application running locally on my phone. TOTP&#x2F;HOTP is dead simple and, with the open source Google Authenticator app, great for the end user.<p>- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=6137051">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=6137051</a></div><br/><div id="37503885" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37503885" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">glandium</span><span>|</span><a href="#37501526">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37501818">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37502045">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37503885">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37503885">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Also, since it doesn&#x27;t allow to extract the private keys, you&#x27;re kind of stuck with it once you&#x27;ve started using it.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37502045" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37502045" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fireflash38</span><span>|</span><a href="#37501526">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37501818">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37503885">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37501567">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37502045">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37502045">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think technically Blizzard Authenticator (even the app) was available before Google Authenticator, but obviously for extremely limited use.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="37501567" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37501567" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">unethical_ban</span><span>|</span><a href="#37501526">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37501598">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37502393">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37501567">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37501567">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Syncing of &quot;MFA codes&quot; is really syncing of the secret component of TOTP (time based one time password).<p>And it&#x27;s a good thing, and damn any 2fa solution that blocks it.

Keep in mind that they&#x27;re simple enough to use that people are making memes with voices generated from ~5 seconds of voice recordings.</div><br/><div id="37506421" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37506421" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xorcist</span><span>|</span><a href="#37501941">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37502841">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37501942">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37506421">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37506421">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Making a meme is nothing like an interactive telephone conversation.<p>It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s impossible, but it&#x27;s not trivial either. But mainly, it&#x27;s just unnecessary.<p>If the user is not fooled by a well crafted phishing, by doing the most trivial countermeasures such as calling back, they are not going to be fooled by a deepfake. In practice work on phishing is mostly better spent elsewhere. So while we shouldn&#x27;t dismiss it completely, it&#x27;s clearly not the case with a smallish company with limited economic value, so very unlikely the case here.<p>There has been a handful of highly profile media cases involving deepfake. None of which has held up on further investigation. It is understandable, nobody wants to be known as the one who didn&#x27;t recognize his own kid on the phone, but the truth is more simple and actually helps us when designing countermeasures.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="37501942" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37501942" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">account-5</span><span>|</span><a href="#37501941">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37503073">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37501942">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37501942">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I wonder how long it&#x27;ll be before a similar attack happens before someone&#x27;s&#x2F;a companies passkeys are synced to the cloud.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37503073" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37503073" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ocdtrekkie</span><span>|</span><a href="#37501942">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37502253">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37503073">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37503073">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The only takeaways you need from this:<p>- Your on-premise customers are the smart ones.
