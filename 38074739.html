In other words, it wasn&#x27;t a surprise move by Apple, and I remember widespread speculation for years beforehand in the broader community (Apple users and otherwise).<p>PPC offered tremendous promise in the early 1990s at the same time Motorola&#x27;s evolution of M68k was lackluster at best - so it made perfect sense that Apple would need to migrate away from M68k, and PPC was the optimal choice so as not to compete directly with hardware used by the PC market.<p>And when Intel&#x2F;AMD were innovating tremendously in the early 2000s while IBM was lagging with bringing out aggressive updates to their PPC line, the switch to Intel seemed inevitable.<p>Even the idea that Apple should heavily develop their ARM mobile chips for future Apple products was discussed heavily in my circles since about 2016 (around the same time Intel started to stagnate their offerings). The earliest I remember was this blog from 2011: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mattrichman.net&#x2F;apple-and-arm-sitting-in-a-tree&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mattrichman.net&#x2F;apple-and-arm-sitting-in-a-tree&#x2F;</a>.</div><br/><div id="38078583" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38078583" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ksec</span><span>|</span><a href="#38077318">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38077572">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38078583">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38078583">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Oh it started way before 2016, I remember it was somewhat discussed within some circles in 2009 &#x2F; 2010 already. At least in the hardware industry enthusiast forum. Remember Apple brought P.A. Semi in 2008. Partnered with Samsung Foundry. And Mac Tablet would come in 2009 before we know it as iPad in 2010 . There were talks &#x2F; rumours and push of Intel becoming a foundry in 2011, and later 2013 they announced Intel Custom Foundry. [1]<p>There were lots and lots of signals in the background that Apple is serious about their chip strategy all the way back in 2009. It wasn&#x27;t so much about switching to ARM as an ISA, which is somehow what most people focused on. But switching to self designed and fabbed SoC for cost efficiency. And that was before the internet knew anything about TSMC or Semiconductor Foundry.<p>[1] I still remember I gave another year to Intel to see if they improve their strategy but BK was simply a complete failure.

Here in the real world, when the M1 came out I was using a precision laptop with (if remembering correctly) 128GB ECC RAM, an 8-core Xeon, and a 1TB NVME SSD. I think it was a 4k boarderless screen, and the battery went about 8-10 hours if I wasn&#x27;t compiling anything. I looked at the M1, and was in no way impressed.<p>No real ECC RAM - just the in-DIMM ECC, which isn&#x27;t ECC at all - it&#x27;s just there because the RAM is so dense you&#x27;d get corruption from regular use w&#x2F;o it.  When you have 128GB or RAM, and you work with medical or financial data, you really need ECC from CPU to RAM.  I also could only get half the RAM I need for work - this enterprise &quot;pro&quot; laptop had less max RAM than literally every competitor.  I ran some GPU-meter thing, and the discrete Nvidia card on my laptop beat the pants off of apple&#x27;s new toy.  I ran a data processing perl script that took over lunch to run on my laptop.  The M1 laptop took half the day.<p>Now, unplugged, the M1 actually did Better than the Dell.  When the Dell got fast, is if I plugged in the 180W powerbrick - or maybe it was even 250W - it was big, and it got quite warm. The laptop sounded like a desktop with its fan on max.  The M1 was quiet but about the same very warm temp.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing - when I want it to be fast to do large data processing, I&#x27;m probably going to have it plugged in.  For real intensive work, I don&#x27;t care about performance per watt.  And when I need it to be portable in a conference room or cafe, both the Dell and the M1 are insanely overpowered anywise.<p>So, I agree with you that it &quot;felt like that all over again&quot; - because you were all over again, comparing the last-gen crap Apple likes to sell during the current year, to the absolutely average stuff they sell now.  The thing is, for Apple&#x27;s price, you don&#x27;t have to buy the average stuff from not-Apple. You could buy top of the line stuff that puts Apple to shame.<p>I&#x27;m not some Intel fanboy - I&#x27;ve worked on and bought lots of Apple stuff for decades for my hobbies. Done lots of photoshop, 3ds max, after effects, protools, etc. That&#x27;s just what that industry works on.  But please don&#x27;t pretend it&#x27;s something revolutionary. The revolutionary part of Apple is getting people to believe their absolutely overpriced average shiny toys are revolutionary.</div><br/><div id="38077832" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38077832" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">scarface_74</span><span>|</span><a href="#38077318">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38077781">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38080360">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38077832">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38077832">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">And the M1 MacBook was quieter, lighter and I could actually sit it on my lap without worrying whether it would prevent me from having little Scarface74’s.<p>Apple didn’t come out with high end ARM Mac laptops until later.

If you not the comment to which I was replying, I am addressing the specific point that the M1 was a revolutionary boost in performance, which it was not. Apple&#x27;s Pro stuff (Intel) at the time was a year behind everyone else on specs.  When their Pro stuff came out - sorry, but even the M2 isn&#x27;t &quot;Pro&quot; anything.<p>What I am doing is comparing top of the line from Apple, to top of the line period.  And consistently, Apple is always behind on workhorses, to get work done.  They are better in your &quot;light quiet slightly longer battery&quot; category. At 50% more cost.  The free laptop from work - I want the most powerful portable thing available.  For personal life, now way I&#x27;m paying the Apple tax.  So - no use case in my life.  I do always get my wife iphones and macbooks though. She teaches languages to little kids and I don&#x27;t want to spend my time helping her with tech stuff, so the Apple tax is worth it. But never for the hardware - just for the walled garden and fisher-price UI for kids.<p>The Precision is not light, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s thick metal that you can run over with a car, and extremely durable.  No one complained about a thinkpad being built sturdy.  For the use case you describe, an XPS with an I7 at the time was super light, got about over 10 hours of battery life if you just did regular office work (no compiling or large data processing), and has similar specs.  I used to take that with when I&#x27;d go internationally.  It absolutely did not get hot - the key was to turn off turbo boost if on battery by setting max CPU at 99%.<p>The thing is, if we compare pricepoints, you could have a Precision for the cost of an M1, and now you have desktop power on the go.  It&#x27;s not super-light, but it&#x27;s still light and thin enough to put in a shoulder bag and not get neck pain.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38079303" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38079303" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jwells89</span><span>|</span><a href="#38077318">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38077832">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38080658">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38080360">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38079303">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38079303">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; And the M1 MacBook was quieter, lighter and I could actually sit it on my lap<p>Yeah this is key. In a laptop that’s meant to be used as a laptop, designing for maximum power at all costs isn’t the winning move. M1 was nice in that it’s plenty powerful while also not making the laptop’s fans scream and being able to survive away from an outlet for several hours despite doing “real work”.<p>In short, balance, which is still surprisingly hard to come by in x86 laptops. If you want a 10lb monster desktop replacement, gaming laptop that does the 2016 Apple thing and crams too many watts into too thin of a chassis, or a really weak ultraportable with mediocre battery life you’ve got plenty of options.

The 640K limit in the IBM PC was due to the IBM PC&#x27;s design. Also, Apple would&#x27;ve considered the 8086 over the 8088, considering the need for memory throughput to have a responsive, fully bitmapped display.<p>The addressing of the 68000 wasn&#x27;t critical for the Mac like the article says; the Mac&#x27;s designers took shortcuts that made 4 megs the limit for the first generation 68000 because it was easy and they had lots of space, although it really wasn&#x27;t the limit because the Mac Portable can have up to 9 megabytes with the original 68000 with 24 bits of address.<p>The Pentium didn&#x27;t compete with the m68040. The Pentium came out after the PowerPC 601. The 80486, which made it to 100 MHz from Intel (higher from other vendors), competed with the m68040.<p>I think some steps were missed between the power-hungry and heat-generating PowerPC and the MacBook Air. I don&#x27;t remember any history showing the Air as something that Apple was trying to, but couldn&#x27;t, make. The issue was that the G4 was good for its time, but there was never a proper G4 successor because the G5 was too power hungry and too hot. If there was some MacBook Air project that never got off the ground during the PowerPC years, I&#x27;d love to hear about it.<p>The comment about performance-per-watt of x86 versus PowerPC was only true of the G5, it&#x27;s worth noting.<p>&quot;Superscalar Architecture&quot; is in the section of the article talking about, &quot;What made Intel x86 CPUs so much better?&quot;, even though Motorola, Intel and PowerPC had been superscalar since the &#x27;90s. Intel definitely improved their superscalar implementations, but they certainly weren&#x27;t unique (&quot;to get superscalar architecture working effectively&quot; is not how I&#x27;d put it).<p>The author wrote, &quot;I had to know what actually caused Intel’s x86 architecture to be so far ahead of its competition.&quot;, but never mentions AMD anywhere in the article. If AMD hadn&#x27;t seriously outperformed Intel and forced Intel to actually compete, and if AMD hadn&#x27;t forced the creation of 64 bit x86, then Intel certainly would not have been an option for Intel. The Pentium 4 had the same heat and power issues as the PowerPC G5. Intel ended up cancelling the Pentium 5 and instead going ahead with a much modernized Pentium III core for their Core release which made up the initial release of Intel Macs because AMD were eating their lunch.<p>There are some other things, but they&#x27;re mostly minor.

&gt; Uhh...8088 is 16-bit CPU<p>The 8086 &#x2F; 8088 have eight registers, four general ones (AX, BX, CX, DX) which are made up of two 8 bit registers (AL, AH, BL, BH, CL, CH, DL, DH), so it&#x27;s both not completely incorrect about 8 bit registers (although I&#x27;d agree that it&#x27;s misleading to say that) but definitely incorrect about the 16 bit data bus.</div><br/><div id="38077532" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38077532" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dmitrygr</span><span>|</span><a href="#38076965">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38077486">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38077390">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38077532">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38077532">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">By that logic, go ahead and call your 64-core AMD threadripper an eight bit processor too.
