How to architect an application at Mastodon scale without relying on databases.
Also I would be very interested in seeing the actual technology rather than reading sensational claims about the unparalled level of scalability it supports.
What does it provide in order to recover from failure and exceptions and to guarantee consistency of state?<p>Relational databases are and will always be necessary as they provide a convenient model for querying, aggregating, joining and reporting data.<p>Much of the value in a database lies in how it supports extracting value from business information rather  what extreme scalability features it supports.<p>Try to create a decent business report from events and then we can speak again.</div><br/><div id="38937892" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38937892" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vmfunction</span><span>|</span><a href="#38937420">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38937878">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38937892">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38937892">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Many many years ago (maybe middle 2000&#x27;s), while working for a company (Flickr competitor) that has customised a Gallery (an open source PHP photo album online).

However it is really difficult to search and run reports on these databaseless Gallery nodes. Database a long with word processing and spreadsheets are one these early days &#x27;killer apps&#x27; that reflected the usefulness of that type of computing usage for humans.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38937878" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38937878" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vidarh</span><span>|</span><a href="#38937420">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38937892">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38936785">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38937878">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38937878">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I mean, AcitivityPub is pretty much the ideal case for this architecture. ActivityPub&#x2F;the underlying ActivityStream consists of activities that manipulates entities. The activities are in principle immutable, even if the entities they may create are not, and you can largely naively serialize them into a log, and partition them naively by actor or by server and actor or any number of schemes, to put them into the initial &quot;depot&quot;.<p>From there, materializing indexes is trivial, and replicating that is also fairly trivial. You &quot;just&quot; need a bunch of workers processing the depot logs into these &quot;P-stores&quot;<p>If your requirements fits that, then recovery from failures &quot;just&quot; requires having replicas of the depots, which is &quot;easy&quot; as you just stream the logs elsewhere, and archive them to, say, a blob store, combined with the ability to reset the &quot;cursors&quot; of the workers populating the P-stores.<p>It&#x27;s an architecture that works very well when you want to index and query large sets of data where the order either doesn&#x27;t matter (much) or you can order &quot;well enough&quot; from the data itself, so you can stream to multiple &quot;depots&quot; without worrying about assigning a global order. Such as ActivityPub.  E.g. it doesn&#x27;t really matter for Mastodon if a reply appears a second before the post its a reply to, because the key linking them together is there and you need to be able to gracefully handle the case where you <i>never</i> get the original or <i>isn&#x27;t even allowed to</i> fetch it.<p>So I don&#x27;t doubt they can achieve this, and a platform that makes that easy would be nice.<p>Their problem is that 1) very few people have data problems that are large enough that it isn&#x27;t easier to &quot;just&quot; buy&#x2F;rent a larger database for the depots, 2) or even that have a dataset large enough that they&#x27;d need a secondary set of servers to handle the materialization of views (or need the views to actually be materialized in the first place), 3) and even if they do, running workers to populate a secondary set isn&#x27;t hard. It&#x27;s also trivial to use tools your devs are already familiar with for the depots and &quot;P-stores&quot;. E.g. Postgres works just fine for both until you have an architecture far larger than most people ever need to deal with, but there are many other options too.<p>Once you start running into challenges with that, the obvious, well-known method is to stream into append-only logs, cut the logs regularly, run the indexers on the new log elements into indexed segments, and zipper merge the log elements and do streaming compression of the values (e.g. arithmetic coding is a common, trivial method) + a skip list. Since the point of these &quot;P-stores&quot; is to reduce the datasets to something where queries are low-complexity, you can generally assume you won&#x27;t need to support much fancy re-ordering and grouping etc., mostly cheap filtering, coupled with streaming merges of query results from multiple P-store partitions. This is the &quot;do it yourself&quot; solution, which you can find &quot;packaged up&quot; in any number of search solutions, like Elasticsearch, Lucene, Sphinx etc., but it&#x27;s also not all that hard to build from scratch for a specific use case.<p>This method has been used for e.g. search engines &quot;forever&quot;. First time any system I worked on actually needed it was ca 2006, and we first used Sphinx, then built a custom one (single developer effort; needed only because Sphinx at the time had only a fraction of the features it has today)<p>Basically, they&#x27;re building a distributed database that just has very opinionated ideas about the type of problems you should be solving and how. If your problem fits in that it&#x27;s very possible they can provide something &quot;turn key&quot; that is more cohesive and better packaged up than picking and choosing your own components for the depot and indexes and writing your own indexing workers, but as you say, to most people the extreme scalability isn&#x27;t the issue and a regular database is enough.<p>Addressing the Twitter and Mastodon cases is kind of a warning here, because both Twitter and Mastodon (the software) started out with a tremendously naive architecture in this respect, so it&#x27;s a low hanging fruit if you want to show off impressive-looking improvements.<p>In terms of reporting, this architecture isn&#x27;t a problem, because you&#x27;d not be working from events, but from the &quot;P-stores&quot; and nothing stops you from ensuring that data is trivially queryable with something reasonable. E.g. either using something like Postgres for the P-stores themselves, or just streaming the data into whatever you want to do reporting from.<p>But again, it doesn&#x27;t need to replace the database.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38936785" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38936785" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">benlivengood</span><span>|</span><a href="#38937420">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38930479">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38936785">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38936785">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I didn&#x27;t notice a mention of transactions in the article, nor of constraints.  It&#x27;s all fine to claim that you can compose arbitrary event source domains together and query them but IMHO the biggest power of RDBMS are transactions and constraints for data integrity.  Maybe Rama comes with amazing composability features that ensure cross-domain constraints, but I would be really surprised if they can maintain globally consistent real-time transactions.<p>I&#x27;ve worked on huge ETL pipelines with materialized views (Photon, Ubiq, Mesa) and the business logic in Ubiq to materialize the view updates for Mesa was immense.  None of it was transactional; everything  was for aggregate statistics and so it worked well.

  My view is, that &#x27;humans are not mature enough for eventsourcing&#x27;. For eventsourcing to work sanely, it must be used responsibly. Reality is, that people make mistakes, and eventsourcing HURTS whenever your developers don&#x27;t act maturely on the common history you have built.
  For us, it has meant a bungee jump of &quot;move ALL the things to eventsourcing&quot;, followed by a long slow painful &#x27;move everything that doesn&#x27;t NEED eventsourcing out of eventsourcing again, into relational database, and only keep the relevant eventsourcing parts in the actual eventsource db&#x27;.<p>The main consequences for us have been &#x27;consume a huge&#x2F;expensive amount of resources&#x27; to do what we already did earlier, with vastly fewer resources, at the benefit of having some things easier to do, and a lot of other things suddenly complex.

It’s actually the same for many of the snarky “your startup doesn’t need horizontal scaling” comments here - if your states are  {building, huge growth, failure} then horizontal scaling is perfect because it keeps your costs low while you’re building and handles the huge growth phase more gracefully.

Just use etcd!<p>Then people will deploy Postgres on top of Kubernetes. Great. Maybe they will deploy it differently, and their database is a bunch of files in &#x2F;etc&#x2F;. Whatever. But you can’t run Kubernetes on Postgres, you wouldn’t want to anyway, the choice to use etcd is very thoughtful. This is an environment designed to simplify the layers of bootstrapping, Kubernetes’s superpower is that it runs as much of its own stuff on top of itself as safe as it is to do so.<p>It still needs a database that is going to be separate from your applications, and unfortunately, for all interesting applications, the line between deployment and business-logical concerns is blurred.<p>So IMO, you will have multiple databases, because logical and deployment concerns are intertwined; deployment concerns need databases; and thus to solve chicken and egg, you’ll have at least 2, hopefully the 1st is super easy to administer.<p>Perhaps you disagree. Maybe you should use dqlite as the only database. It’s so naive to think anything is CP as long as there’s consensus in front of it.

A system that allows products to be purchased and fulfilled is a far closer match to what the majority of companies are using software for compared to writing a Twitter clone.<p>Here&#x27;s my take -- at a certain point in scale and volume using a database, it actually does make sense to rewrite all of the following from scratch:<p>- query planning<p>- indexing (btree vs GIN, etc) and primary&#x2F;foreign&#x2F;unique key structure<p>- persistence layer<p>- locking<p>- enforcing ACID constraints<p>- schema migrations&#x2F;DDL<p>- security, accounts and permissioning<p>- encryption primitives<p>But more crucially, my belief and experience is that most companies making lots of money from software products will NEVER remotely reach that scale -- and prematurely optimizing for that is not just the wrong decision but borderline professional malpractice.

Most businesses in my experience have a domain that is modeled pretty well in a relational DB.

They still suffer from complexity due to mutable state, but the architectural separation of source of truth vs &quot;views&quot; can be implemented inside the one database, using an append only table and materialized views.

I&#x27;ll list some of them:<p>* I&#x27;m pretty sure restrictive schemas are a feature not a bug, but I suppose you can add your own in your ETL &quot;microbatch streaming&quot; implementation (if I&#x27;m reading this right, this is where you transform the events&#x2F;data that have been recorded to the indexed form your app wants to query). So you could, e.g., filter out any data with invalid schema, and&#x2F;or record and error about the invalid data, etc. A pain, though, for it to be a separate thing to implement.<p>* I&#x27;m not that excited to have my data source and objects&#x2F;entities be Java.<p>* The Rama business model and sustainability story seem like big question marks that would have to have strong, long-lasting answers&#x2F;guarantees before anyone should invest too much in this. This is pretty different and sits at a fundamental level of abstraction. If you built on this for years (or decades) and then something happened you could be in serious trouble.<p>* Hosting&#x2F;deployment&#x2F;resources-needed is unclear (to me, anyway)<p>* Quibble on &quot;Data models are restrictive&quot;: common databases are pretty flexible these days, supporting different models well.<p>* I&#x27;m thinking a lot of apps won&#x27;t get too much value from keeping their events around forever, so that becomes a kind of anchor around the neck, a cost that apps using Rama have to pay whether they really want it or not. I have questions about how that scales over time. E.g., say my has depot has 20B events and I want to add an index to a p-state or a new value to an enum... do I need to ETL 20 billion events to do routine changes&#x2F;additions? And obviously schema changes get a lot more complicated than that. I get that you could have granular pstates but then I start worrying about the distributed nature of this. I guess you would generally do migrations by creating new pstates with the new structure, take as much time as you need to populate them, then cut over as gradually as you need, and then retire the old pstates on whatever timeline you want.... But that&#x27;s a lot of work you want to avoid doing routinely, I&#x27;d think.<p>I&#x27;m starting to think of more things, but I better stop (my build finished long ago!)</div><br/><div id="38934011" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38934011" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nathanmarz</span><span>|</span><a href="#38932607">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38935139">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38934011">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38934011">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">* By &quot;restrictive schemas&quot; I mean being forced to represent your data storage in non-optimal ways – like not being able to have nested objects in a first-class way. Schemas themselves are extremely important, and they should be as tight as possible.<p>* Rama&#x27;s JVM-based, so the entire ecosystem is available to you. You can represent data as primitive types, Java objects, Protobuf, Clojure records, etc.<p>* You deploy and manage your own Rama clusters. The number of nodes &#x2F; instance types depends on the app, but Rama doesn&#x27;t use more resources than traditional architectures combining multiple tools.<p>* Some databases support multiple very specific data models (e.g. Redis). I don&#x27;t consider that flexible compared to Rama, which allows for arbitrary combinations of arbitrarily sized data structures of arbitrary partitioning.<p>* Depots (the &quot;event sourcing&quot; part of Rama) can be optionally trimmed. So you can configure it to only keep the last 2M entries per partition, for example. Some applications need this, while others don&#x27;t.<p>* If you&#x27;re adding a new PState, it&#x27;s up to you how far back in the depot to start. For example, you could say &quot;start from events appended after a specific timestamp&quot; or &quot;start from 10M records ago on each partition&quot;.<p>* We have a first-class PState migrations feature coming very soon. These migrations are lazy, so there&#x27;s no downime. Basically you can specify a migration function at any level of your PStates, and the migration functions are run on read. In the background, it migrates iterates over the PState to migrate every value on disk (throttled so as not to use too many resources).</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38935139" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38935139" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nojvek</span><span>|</span><a href="#38932607">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38930807">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38935139">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38935139">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Read the tutorial<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redplanetlabs.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;~&#x2F;tutorial1.html#gsc.tab=0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redplanetlabs.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;~&#x2F;tutorial1.html#gsc.tab=0</a><p>This is quite complex compared to setting up Postgres or mysql and sending some sql over some port.<p>I’m not sure I get what they are selling.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38930807" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38930807" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">manicennui</span><span>|</span><a href="#38935139">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38930792">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38930807">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38930807">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A lot of these same problems were solved in a similar way with Datomic and xtdb.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.datomic.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.datomic.com&#x2F;</a>
