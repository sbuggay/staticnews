I work on Bluesky and helped build the AT Protocol. I&#x27;m sorry Sam differs with us on this, and I&#x27;m glad that Activity Pub is already there for him. However, Sam doesn&#x27;t understand the ATProto very well and I want to clear it up a bit.<p>Before I do, let me just say: Bluesky and the AT Proto are in beta. The stuff that seems incomplete or poorly documented <i>is</i> incomplete and poorly documented. Everything has moved enormously faster than we expected it to. We have around 65k users on the beta server right now. We _thought_ that this would be a quiet, stealthy beta for us while we finished the technology and the client. We&#x27;ve instead gotten a ton of attention, and while that&#x27;s wonderful it means that we&#x27;re getting kind of bowled over. So I apologize for the things that aren&#x27;t there yet. I haven&#x27;t really rested in over a month.<p>ATProto doesn&#x27;t use crypto in the coin sense. It uses cryptography. The underlying premise is actually pretty similar to git. Every user runs a data repository where commits to the repository are signed. The data repositories are synced between nodes to exchange data, and interactions are committed as records to the repositories.<p>The purpose of the data repository is to create a clear assertion of the user&#x27;s records that can be gossiped and cached across the network. We sign the records so that authenticity can be determined without polling the home server, and we use a repository structure rather than signing individual records so that we can establish whether a record has been deleted (signature revocation).<p>Repositories are pulled through replication streams. We chose not to push events to home servers because you can easily overwhelm a home server with a lot of burst loads when some content goes viral, which in turn makes self hosting too expensive. If a home server wants to crawl &amp; pull records or repositories it can, and there&#x27;s a very sensible model for doing so based on its users&#x27; social graph. However the general goal is to create a global network that aggregates activity (such as likes) across the entire network, and so we use large scale aggregation services to provide that aggregated firehose. Unless somebody solves federated queries with the sufficient performance then any network that&#x27;s trying to give a global view is going to need similar large indexes. If you don&#x27;t want a global view that&#x27;s fine, then you want a different product experience and you can do that with ATProto. You can also use a different global indexer than the one we provide, same as search engines.<p>The schema is a well-defined machine language which translates to static types and runtime validation through code generation. It helps us maintain correctness when coordinating across multiple servers that span orgs, and any protocol that doesn&#x27;t have one is informally speccing its logic across multiple codebases and non-machine-readable specs. The schema helps the system with extensibility and correctness, and if there was something off the shelf that met all our needs we would&#x27;ve used it.<p>The DID system uses the recovery key to move from one server to another without coordinating with the server (ie because it suddenly disappeared). It supports key rotations and it enables very low friction moves between servers without any loss of past activity or data. That design is why we felt comfortable just defaulting to our hosting service; because we made it easy to switch off after the fact if&#x2F;when you learn there&#x27;s a better option. Given that the number one gripe about activitypub&#x27;s onboarding is server selection, I think we made the right call.<p>We&#x27;ll keep writing about what we&#x27;re doing and I hope we change some minds over time. The team has put a lot of thought into the work, and we really don&#x27;t want to fight with other projects that have a similar mission.</div><br/><div id="35885122" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35885122" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sgtnoodle</span><span>|</span><a href="#35881905">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35884187">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35885122">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35885122">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Not having read the article, I got pretty far into your second paragraph before realizing you all aren&#x27;t talking about configuring a modem over a serial link.

Some comments:<p>&gt; We sign the records so that authenticity can be determined without polling the home server, and we use a repository structure rather than signing individual records so that we can establish whether a record has been deleted (signature revocation).<p>Why do you need an entirely separate protocol to do this? Email had this exact same problem, yet was able to build protocols <i>on top of it</i> in order to fix the authenticity problem. This is the issue: instead of using ActivityPub, which is simpler to implement, more generic, and significantly easier for developers to understand, you invented an overly-complex alternative that doesn&#x27;t work with the rest of the federated Internet.<p>&gt; The schema is a well-defined machine language which translates to static types and runtime validation through code generation. It helps us maintain correctness when coordinating across multiple servers that span orgs, and any protocol that doesn&#x27;t have one is informally speccing its logic across multiple codebases and non-machine-readable specs.<p>OpenAPI specs already exist and do the same job. They support much more tooling and are much easier for developers to understand. There is objectively no reason why you could not have used them, you are literally just making GET and POST requests with XRPC. If you really wanted to you could&#x27;ve used GraphQL.<p>There are plenty of protocols which do not include machine-readable specs (including TCP, IP, and HTTP) that are incredibly reliable and work just fine. If you make the protocol simple to understand and easy to implement, you really don&#x27;t need this (watch Simple Made Easy by Rich Hickey).<p>&gt; The DID system uses the recovery key to move from one server to another without coordinating with the server (ie because it suddenly disappeared).<p>Why is this necessary? The likelihood of a server just randomly disappearing is incredibly low. There are community standards and things like the Mastodon Server Covenant that make this essentially a non-issue. You&#x27;re storing all of a user&#x27;s post history on their own device in the case of an immediate outage. That&#x27;s equivalent to Gmail storing all of your emails on your device in case you want to immediately pack up and move to another email provider. That is an extremely high cost (I have 55k tweets, that would be a nightmare to host locally) for an outcome that is very unlikely.<p>&gt; It supports key rotations and it enables very low friction moves between servers without any loss of past activity or data.<p>This forces community servers to store even more data, data that may not even be relevant or useful. Folks might have gigabytes of attachments and hundreds of thousands of tweets. That is not a fast or easy thing to import if you&#x27;re hosting a community server. This stacks the decks against community servers.<p>Most people want <i>some</i> of their content archived, not all, and there is no reason why <i>archival</i> can be separate from <i>where content is posted</i>.

Their view on federation isn&#x27;t exactly what I&#x27;m looking for (&quot;a bunch of Twitters that can theoretically interoperate&quot; rather than a decentralized platform) but I suppose only having one or two main servers does solve the &quot;I don&#x27;t know whether to pick outlook.com or gmail.com&quot; problem that many new Mastodon users seem to face.<p>ActivityPub is no walk in the park either. It&#x27;s a protocol closer to &quot;the HTTP of social media&quot; than a way to interoperate with other servers. Basic functionality is easy, all you need is a few static JSON files, but if you want to write an application around it you&#x27;re going to have to dive deep into the docs.<p>What I don&#x27;t really see is why BlueSky decided to make its own protocol. Like Mastodon is an API that works on top of ActivityPub, BlueSky could&#x27;ve just been a better ActivityPub server as far as I can tell. Most of the big problems (&quot;my toots disappeared after the server shut down&quot;) can be resolved without an entirely new protocol.<p>Going back to the drawing board seems like an excellent way to find all the hurdles every other protocol already encountered. The recent &quot;official&quot; s3 account is just one example of that, and I&#x27;m sure there will be more.<p>Maybe the value add of the AT protocol will become clearer once it&#x27;s finished. I&#x27;m sure there will be ATProto &lt;-&gt; ActivityPub bridges to make both networks integrate for the people who wish to do so.

It&#x27;s fundamentally not possible to do what they promise unless there is some kind of synchronization point where your most up-to-date identity can be searched. The documentation goes on extensively about the format of DIDs and the fact that there _is_ a resolution scheme, but it fails to mention that this resolution is being done by Bluesky themselves, and is not planned to expand into something that others can control. As a decentralized protocol, you would expect this to be something DNS-based, or if you really wanted something more peer-to-peer, DHT lookup, or at the worst case, a distributed blockchain. Seeing as this is a fundamental protocol-level change, the fact that they&#x27;re rolling with the current approach makes me believe they will not be changing this in the near future.

I don’t like how accounts and servers work in Mastodon and the federation and global discovery approach sucks too.<p>The best thing we can do now is keep an open mind and try as many approaches as possible, because if something better than ActivityPub doesn’t come along society is stuck with centralised social media forever.</div><br/><div id="35885082" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35885082" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vidarh</span><span>|</span><a href="#35881924">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35884688">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35883858">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35885082">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35885082">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Fediverse posts are signed with public key crypto (e.g. I&#x27;m looking at signatures for my post literally in the window next to my browser right now). It could use a multi-sig model so you&#x27;d be able to unilaterally prove claims about your posts, but that&#x27;s not an ActivityPub limitation or issue. If you want to store it locally first, the only thing stopping you currently is that current servers are clunky, not the protocol. You don&#x27;t give much detail of the specifics of why you think the protocol is the problem, so I can&#x27;t address much more than that.<p>ActivityPub is <i>very</i> generic;  it can accommodate all kinds of changes. E.g. if you want to introduce activity &#x2F; object types that have improvements over what Mastodon supports,  you can do so. If you want to introduce vocabulary <i>within</i> existing object types that Mastodon wouldn&#x27;t understand, you can do so without breaking federation with Mastodon or other Fediverse servers. I&#x27;d be a lot more sympathetic to anyone who decided to extend ActivityPub.<p>The minimum viable subset of ActivityPub is largely: Provide an endpoint that returns an Actor with a list of the required endpoints (inbox, outbox, follower, following etc.) - the spec requires a list of them, but you don&#x27;t even need all of them for basic interop - and handle POST&#x27;s to your announced inbox, and GET requests to the outbox. Add unique URL&#x27;s as &quot;id&quot; fields in the JSON, and support GET to them. Follow the format of the JSON to provide at least the minimum set of fields to address the activity, provide a type, and provide the minimum fields for the given type.<p>For interop w&#x2F;Mastodon you&#x27;d want to support Webfinger to find the Actor. Nothing stops you from <i>also</i> supporting other mechanisms, like BlueSky&#x27;s domain validation.<p>Nothing stops you from supporting additional federation mechanisms. Nothing stops you from providing additional fields. Nothing stops you from storing data locally. Nothing stops you from adding additional ways of signing claims about individual objects or a whole repository of objects. Nothing stops you from providing additional mechanisms for distributed lookup of objects by id.  Many of those things would be welcome if people wanted to do it on top of ActivityPub.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="35883858" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35883858" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nr2x</span><span>|</span><a href="#35881924">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35882387">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35884688">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35884576">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35883858">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35883858">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">“We have a thing that is arcane and hasn’t taken off with the public so don’t make a new one” isn’t exactly a stellar argument.<p>The only winning move is to onboard users and given hundreds of millions of people may be looking to leave Twitter, Mastodon utterly shit the bed and missed the moment.<p>That’s the end of the story: if the system can’t catch users raining down from the sky during a generational upheaval in social media it ain’t never gonna make it.</div><br/></div></div><div id="35884576" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35884576" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Sytten</span><span>|</span><a href="#35881924">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35882387">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35883858">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35883785">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35884576">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35884576">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My experience with mastodon is that both explore and the feed are miles behind the experience I have on twitter to discover content I care about.

Heck, even a Wordpress plugin in the works.<p>How well all these things will scale etc. is still somewhat of a question mark but this aspect feels important beyond specific details and choices. The simpler, more generic an approach, the more likely it is to find fertile ground and grow as a decentralized architecture. The original decentralized Web was simple and generic and this has been touted as key factor for its explosive adoption.<p>In a sense this was also its ultimate downfall: it did not provide (out of the box) the tools to build the connectivity &#x2F; social graph experience that was so enormously desirable (and was not provided e.g., by RSS).

Quoting from the FAQ:<p>&gt; Account portability is the major reason why we chose to build a separate protocol.<p>There is a widely-accepted account portability protocol built on top of ActivityPub that multiple servers, including Mastodon and Pleroma, all support.<p>&gt; We consider portability to be crucial because it protects users from sudden bans, server shutdowns, and policy disagreements.<p>There is nothing inherent about their protocol that solves this. The app on iOS (the Bluesky app) solves this by downloading all tweets locally, which is incredibly space-inefficient and keeps the server from... doing the job of a server (storing that data for you). Additionally, user data is still accessible and downloadable after a suspension on Mastodon and Pleroma.<p>&gt; Our solution for portability requires both signed data repositories and DIDs, neither of which are easy to retrofit into ActivityPub.<p>There is quite literally no need for this and they absolutely could have built something that addresses these issues on top of ActivityPub. We&#x27;re talking about the people who couldn&#x27;t use OpenAPI, but instead built a shittier version of GraphQL while bold-faced saying &#x27;there was no alternative&#x27;.<p>&gt; a preference for domain usernames over AP’s double-@ email usernames<p>No need to build a separate protocol for this.<p>&gt; and the goal of having large scale search and discovery (rather than the hashtag style of discovery that ActivityPub favors).<p>Nothing about ActivityPub, Mastodon, or the general Fediverse prohibits you from scraping it to make this happen. There are services that do this right now. Mastodon has discovery built into it, this literally completely ignores that.<p>ActivityPub is <i>the</i> standard for federation on the internet, and for allowing interoperation between social networks. That is the key here. I don&#x27;t give a shit if people use Mastodon. I myself probably wouldn&#x27;t use it if I wasn&#x27;t running a Mastodon server.<p>What I <i>do</i> care about is whether a service is built on ActivityPub. Even if my friends want to use another social media service (maybe they&#x27;re on PixelFed or whatever it&#x27;s called), I can still follow them and interact with them over there while using Mastodon. You cannot do that with Bluesky.<p>The problems that Bluesky identified with ActivityPub objectively could&#x27;ve been solved by building something on top of ActivityPub, retaining the &#x27;interoperable social network&#x27; quality of it. Email had the same problems, and instead of throwing out the email protocol, we built DMARC and co on top of it.<p>So no, I don&#x27;t want people to use Mastodon, I don&#x27;t give a shit about people using Mastodon. I literally criticized Mastodon later on in the thread. What I care about is interoperability, ease of use, and open standards, and AtProto is objectively not that.</div><br/><div id="35885188" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35885188" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vidarh</span><span>|</span><a href="#35881625">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35882956">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35883258">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35885188">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35885188">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">To add regarding the signatures and portability, Mastodon at least signs its posts with JSON-LD signatures. They&#x27;re in the downloaded archive I got from mastodon.social when I moved off it, for example. So is the key required to validate them.<p>The only thing missing there to make this better - and this is <i>not</i> an ActivityPub thing - is including those JSON-LD signatures in more contexts, so that you don&#x27;t need to rely on the export functionality (of Mastodon) to get an archive, allowing clients to choose to keep a local copy (or nominate someone to back it up for them), and providing an <i>upload</i> functionality for posts (Mastodon doesn&#x27;t do this, but that&#x27;s also a Mastodon thing, not an ActivityPub thing).<p>I wouldn&#x27;t have had an issue if they added extensions to ActivityPub. There are even things Mastodon refuses to add that I&#x27;d applaud people for forcing the issue on by adding extensions to support. But their choice to reinvent everything puts me off.</div><br/></div></div><div id="35883258" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35883258" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">howinteresting</span><span>|</span><a href="#35881625">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35882956">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35885188">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35883258">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35883258">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">At an <i>incredibly</i> practical level, bootstrapping a new ecosystem in closed beta that isn&#x27;t linked to the fediverse has been really great at attracting posters from Twitter who find the original fediverse too stale and curmudgeonly.</div><br/><div id="35883417" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35883417" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sleepybrett</span><span>|</span><a href="#35881625">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35883258">parent</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35883417">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35883417">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Just like twitter before it, and every other social network, they change in tone over time.
