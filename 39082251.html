The distro as a whole is not bad actually. Especially since it switched to Yocto.<p>I found that most of the actual issues we were having were due to the BSPs we were pulling in from other vendors. And WRL supported&#x2F;probably still does _a lot_ of BSPs from _a lot_ of vendors for _a lot_ of architectures.<p>There are not that many commercially supported _embedded_ linux distributions. And WRL worked quite well for the vast majority of its customers. And I am proud to have had the honor of working with a lot of smart people there too.<p>My favorite part of the whole experience was that when breakage <i>did</i> happen, it was super quick to fix and get it into mainline. It was the first time I saw such a streamlined release process. Other companies had a release process so convoluted that it would take over half a year for a fix of mine to reach the customer.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39085003" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39085003" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xyzzy_plugh</span><span>|</span><a href="#39087301">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39085962">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39085003">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39085003">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A powerful three word phrase that summons forth buried trauma for many.

For a while, we kept running Wind River, but I replaced glibc with one I built completely not using anything from Wind River, and eventually all packages, config files and scripts in rootfs, and the kernel, until there was nothing left of Wind River.<p>At that time, those WR clowns hadn&#x27;t figured out how to build a cross-compiled Bash that had job control. Everyone was relieved when they could use Ctrl-Z suspend and fg&#x2F;bg on the target with our home spun package.<p>Funny thing is, that startup spent about a year looking for someone to do all this, while I worked on some C++ application stuff. Then they realized the person works there already.<p>Didn&#x27;t Wind River have some awful build process that stitched together files from disparate fragments? Or something? My memories are fuzzy.<p>On this project, I had the idea of doing all patching of packages with Quilt. Yocto does that now. Years later when I had to add some patch to a Yocto package, I went into the build directory and, oh, lookie, I already know how to do this with my eyes closed.<p>I made ever single package cleanly cross-compile for MIPS: no Qemu on the build machine.

A lot of people remember Wind River from VxWorks but I&#x27;m not sure as many realized they moved on to real time Linux many years ago. Someone saw, posted. That or simply coincidence for the same reason :).<p>Also the HN title is actually edited and accidentally implies the wrong thing. Wind River Linux is a source only solution which has been around ages while what this page actually links to ,Wind River Linux Distro (launched in 2022), is a binary distro for certain platforms. Finger in the wind guessing says probably not the intended reason for posting given the title messes up the distinction though.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39085653" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39085653" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">voakbasda</span><span>|</span><a href="#39085251">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39084857">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39085653">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39085653">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In a past job, I had to pick up and maintain an embedded system running Wind River Linux.
