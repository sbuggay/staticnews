Perhaps depends on the type of warning shot.

One lesson is that it got not much priority (the vehicle itself released in air and ocean water), and not much effort: lots of things in the lab were not tested or designed sufficiently (broken glove &#x2F; gloveboxes, fire procedures involving breaching containment...) Another lesson is that this was apparently not tested or wargamed anywhere enough. No test run? A third is that of course it didn&#x27;t go perfect, with the two first points as a starting point, and the fact that it was the first run. In hindsight, of course it would fail.<p>That argues for at least taking the idea of containment (for AI or Mars samples) more seriously. But it also argues that it will (of course) not be taken seriously enough. Plus amateurs not taking things seriously either. So, taking it even more seriously because of this prior experience.<p>Science is used to &quot;fair warnings&quot; (screwdriver criticality experiments, Marie Curie, now lunar samples, but yes also smallpox ... plenty of stories) - but all of these were minor: a few persons died, the rest learned. And the risk for a sufficient AI is not in the same scale. For that one, we don&#x27;t have much experience. Comparable might be high containment pathogen labs maybe? - with plenty of problems themselves; and the difficulty of cleaning computers after an intrusion (proper procedure being a clean re-install - not possible for an AI leak.)</div><br/></div></div><div id="38907044" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38907044" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">boznz</span><span>|</span><a href="#38903716">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38905310">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38908128">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38907967">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38907044">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38907044">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">NASA had an easy win putting the astronauts in quarantine, there is no such easy win for current AI research, you can whistle-blow as much as you want but AGI will be worked on until it is real, regardless of legislation unless that legislation covers all countries which is impossible.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38907967" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38907967" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">creer</span><span>|</span><a href="#38903716">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38905310">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38907044">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38904549">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38907967">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38907967">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.ph&#x2F;abuKE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.ph&#x2F;abuKE</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38904549" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38904549" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">andrewflnr</span><span>|</span><a href="#38903716">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38905310">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38905050">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38904549">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38904549">[8 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Not a great analogy.

In the case of going to the moon, the most reasonable prior for &quot;astronauts pick something up that then returns with them intact and is able to survive in highly oxidizing atmosphere&quot; should be near zero.  The prior for &quot;we bring something to the Moon that somehow contaminates the place&quot; should be significantly higher than that, yet still very small.  This is, of course, taking into account that we didn&#x27;t know how hardy tardigrades and some of the various types of extremophiles could be then.  But, IMO, I still don&#x27;t think that should raise the risk estimate of bringing anything back very much, nor should it raise the risk estimate for contaminating the place to anything approaching that of any of the very real possibilities for which NASA literally had 8+ contingency plans.  And I say all that even while factoring in that the potential impact of bringing something back that would be able to survive could be the destruction of humanity, destruction of Earth&#x27;s biosphere (and all of humanity with it), or any of a number of other existential risk scenarios.<p>With AI, those probabilities are all flipped on their heads.  The reason we know of some of the risks, <i>e.g.</i> the risk of deep fakes being used as tools for fraud, is because <i>they have already happened.</i>  That one single scenario alone having already come to fruition takes whatever anyone should have for a prior probability of said risk and shoots it straight up to 100%.  And, that alone is a key difference between AI today and lunar or terrestrial contamination by alien life in the 1960s.<p>Let us not also forget that there are many, <i>many</i> other risk scenarios than deepfakes being used for fraudulent purposes.  Much as I hate to reference Rumsfeld on this, there truly <i>are</i> &quot;unknown unknowns&quot; here, and we have to take that seriously.  And then there are the middle ground scenarios, such as the possibility of severe and lasting economic disruption, to the point where capitalism might not be able to function as it has for the past several centuries.  I truly don&#x27;t believe that any foreseeable &quot;internal&quot; risk[0] could cause capitalism to completely stop working forever, unless we just run out of stuff to dig up out of the dirt, but AI certainly could cause multiple decades of disruption, which would be nearly as bad for most people alive today.<p>I&#x27;m gonna cut myself off there, because I think this is getting a little ponderous, but also because I think my point is made now: biotic contamination, whether forward or reverse, involved a sum of a lot of hypotheticals with very low probabilities, whereas AI risk involves a sum of some certainties, a few potential (though perhaps low probability) existential risks, and also an indeterminate number of unknown risks of unknown probability.  It seems pretty clear once you crunch it all out that AI is certainly the greater threat.<p>---<p>[0] Mmeaning one that originates within capitalism itself, like AI, rather than one that originates outside of capitalism, but puts pressure on the system, like climate change..</div><br/></div></div><div id="38904658" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38904658" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gumballindie</span><span>|</span><a href="#38903716">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38909505">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38906371">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38904658">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38904658">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A great analogy indeed - ai, as moon life, turned out to be false alarms.</div><br/><div id="38905033" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38905033" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">LargeTomato</span><span>|</span><a href="#38903716">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38904658">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38906371">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38905033">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38905033">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You can easily harm people with ai.
