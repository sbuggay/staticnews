The continued existence of UNRWA is a problem—but not for the reasons its critics think...</i><p>&gt; <i>This is a problem—but not one of UNRWA&#x27;s making. Blame instead the Arab states that have refused, for decades, to offer citizenship to the Palestinians in their midst. The 1.7m registered refugees in Gaza (or their ancestors) lived under Egyptian control for almost two decades until 1967. Instead of offering them rights, Egypt left them in squalor.</i><p>Similarly:<p>&gt; <i>In many ways, UNRWA was the government. Hamas officials have all but admitted this in interviews over the past few months. They said Hamas’s role was to build up its military capabilities, not to care for their people—they had do-gooders for that. Israel, too, relied on UNRWA to mitigate the consequences of the draconian blockade that it (along with Egypt) imposed on Gaza. Even today, as Israel tries to abolish UNRWA, it still relies on the agency to prevent mass starvation in Gaza.</i><p>It&#x27;s not the UNRWA that is trying to perpetuate itself. It is the actions of several countries that force the continued status of refugee on the Palestinians, Hamas not taking over basic governmental services, and Israel not providing humanitarian services in Gaza. The UNRWA is doing its best to do necessary humanitarian work when others aren&#x27;t stepping up.<p>The idea that UNRWA is the primary party responsible for perpetuating the situation, in order to therefore perpetuate its existence, couldn&#x27;t be further from the truth.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.economist.com&#x2F;middle-east-and-africa&#x2F;2024&#x2F;02&#x2F;15&#x2F;the-real-problem-with-the-uns-agency-for-palestinians" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.economist.com&#x2F;middle-east-and-africa&#x2F;2024&#x2F;02&#x2F;15&#x2F;...</a></div><br/><div id="39497342" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39497342" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">smsm42</span><span>|</span><a href="#39496538">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39497035">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39497750">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39497342">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39497342">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; neighbor states actively blocking solutions that would therefore allow the UNRWA to disband<p>UNRWA though is what enables them to do so. If a state has 1m refugees on your soil that don&#x27;t have any support mechanisms, it&#x27;s this state&#x27;s big problem and they&#x27;d be soon forced to find some solutions, as it routinely happened with other refugees. To be clear, not all of these solutions are very good, but at least there would be a pressure on the host country to find one. With UNRWA, it is taking care of the &quot;refugees&quot; - who aren&#x27;t actual refugees for 2 generations already, btw - so no pressure on somebody else to do anything. In fact, it&#x27;s an established policy - when one of the prominent Hamas leaders was asked, why don&#x27;t you work to take care of Gaza population, he answered - it&#x27;s not my business, my business is to fight Israel (he didn&#x27;t use the word, of course), and UNRWA business is to take care and feed people. Without UNRWA, this wouldn&#x27;t be possible - no people would tolerate a government that doesn&#x27;t bother to provide even minimal care to them. But UNRWA provides this safety net that enables the perpetuation of that situation. Hamas can be 100% full time terrorists, because they know the population wouldn&#x27;t revolt - they have UNRWA to supply their basic needs.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s not the UNRWA that is trying to perpetuate itself. It is the actions of several countries that force the continued status of refugee on the Palestinians<p>UNRWA certainly isn&#x27;t doing anything to stop it or voice any objection at all to it, as far as I know. They never asked or acted in any way to make anybody except them to step up.<p>&gt; Israel not providing humanitarian services in Gaza<p>Israel provided a ton of humanitarian services to Gaza. Of course that was before people from Gaza murdered over 1300 of people from Israel and kidnapped over another 200. Then the idea kinda lost its attraction for a bit. One of the most cruel parts here that many of those who were murdered were of the most active participants in providing those services, and in fact for many of them that was exactly the reason they went to live so close to Gaza - because they wanted to help.</div><br/><div id="39498138" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39498138" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">intended</span><span>|</span><a href="#39496538">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39497342">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39497750">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39498138">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39498138">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Hey - let’s call out Hamas as opposed to the people of Gaza.

Where do you put your savings? Some of it you still keep locally, for practical reasons, but the rest you invest abroad. Where? A peer country with the same issues? A developing country where investment never comes back? A small banking haven that will fold at the first sign of hard power? Or do you send it to the rabidly capitalist country with a 50 year track record of delivering investor returns and dozens of aircraft carriers and nuclear submarines to put between your bank account and the New Workers Collective of Yourlandia?

The physicist found an innovative solution that was too simple and just worked.  When he demonstrated it to everyone, he thought everyone would be very happy.  On the contrary, his manager started having unexplained issues with him and he was shortly let go.<p>He has ultimately given up on corporate politics and is currently a physics teacher at a usual local college.<p>As the physics teacher, he found that the students in his class barely knew basic stuff (vector addition, etc.) from the pre-requisite courses.  He tried to teach to cover up.  He diligently and fairly checked the answers&#x2F;solutions from the students in the mid-term exams, and found that practically no one passed.<p>He was shortly called by the college dean and heard back.  The dean&#x27;s primary concern was that irrespective of whether students actually learn or not, if so many fail the exams, the college would get shut down.<p>He is now forced to pass the students even while he realizes that by passing them now, he&#x27;s setting them up for failure in the future if they actually pursue physics.<p>I surmise that if the Shirky Principle were to stop acting, say 80% of projects&#x2F;institutions may just go away and should.<p>----<p>In some cases, it&#x27;s even worse -- Institutions invent fake problems that they allege to be the solution for and then of course never solve them.</div><br/><div id="39493910" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39493910" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">matthewdgreen</span><span>|</span><a href="#39493604">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39496534">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39493910">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39493910">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">On the one hand, your friend could just be experiencing a streak of bad luck or a series of bad organizations.

San Francisco&#x27;s annual budget includes (these are all approximate) $420m for permanent housing, $60m for immediate shelter, and $120m for homelessness prevention, so we&#x27;re talking roughly $600m plus a large chunk of the $250m that&#x27;s budgeted for mental health interventions. So we&#x27;re talking close to a billion dollars a year out of a $14 billion city budget.<p>The denominator becomes tricky too, in that SFO has an estimated given-night homeless population of about 8000, about half of whom are rough sleepers (people literally camped out on the street&#x2F;under bridges). Note that this is a high proportion of rough sleepers compared to most cities where it&#x27;s about a quarter of the homeless population. That translates into about 32000 people experiencing homelessness at some point in a given year (at least that&#x27;s the rule of thumb I remember from -- wait for it -- working at a homelessness NGO years ago). So the most naive calculation shakes out to $850m spent on 32000 people, or just north of $27K.<p>Obviously this has some problems, in that at least <i>some</i> of the homelessness prevention money is hopefully preventing a non-zero number of people from becoming homeless (though in my more cynical moments I wonder). But then again somebody who&#x27;s only homeless for a month shouldn&#x27;t need a full year&#x27;s spending.<p>TL;DR: it&#x27;s complicated and there&#x27;s not a single answer everybody agrees on, but in terms of orders of magnitude it&#x27;s &quot;tens of thousands of dollars per person per year&quot; in most large US cities, with SF as an outlier on the high end.<p>(If you <i>really</i> want to get depressed, look at European cities like Amsterdam or Berlin which have homelessness rates approaching double most US cities&#x27; and even higher expenditures.)</div><br/><div id="39496436" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39496436" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">generic92034</span><span>|</span><a href="#39496020">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39496361">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39498470">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39496436">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39496436">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; (If you really want to get depressed, look at European cities like Amsterdam or Berlin which have homelessness rates approaching double most US cities&#x27; and even higher expenditures.)<p>Could you please provide some links to those figures?

  (Phong Ngo)

  Oh, give me a pity, I&#x27;m on a committee
  Which means that from morning to night
  We attend and amend and contend and defend
  Without a conclusion in sight.

  We confer and concur, we defer and demur
  And re-iterate all of our thoughts
  We revise the agenda with frequent addenda
  And consider a load of reports.

  We compose and propose, we suppose and oppose
  And the points of procedure are fun!
  But though various notions are brought up as motion
  There&#x27;s terribly little gets done.

  We resolve and absolve, but never dissolve
  Since it&#x27;s out of the question for us.
  What a shattering pity to end our committee
  Where else could we make such a fuss?

I agree that improving efficiency is a fair counterargument.<p>&gt; picking up trash every day<p>Yeah, I think that Gall should have started with &quot;twice a week&quot; instead of daily (he might actually use &quot;twice a week&quot; in the book, and the &quot;daily&quot; reference is an error on my part). When you start from bi-weekly to weekly, I&#x27;m not sure if the improving efficiency argument holds up that well. I could see twice a week being as efficient as once a week.<p>Not sure about the automation argument in terms of improved efficiency. Brazilian trash collectors work very quickly and do not rely on automation. However I think they&#x27;re also subjected to more occupational hazard by personally handling more trash. Maybe they&#x27;re not more efficient. Even if you are more efficient, does the &quot;anergy&quot; (i.e. shifting the problem) idea mean that your improved efficiency essentially enables the community to generate far more trash per capita?<p>Re: unions to be clear, there&#x27;s no moral judgment intended. It&#x27;s just another example of the system opposing its own intended function. The purpose is to collect trash, striking workers is one of the ways that the system opposes itself. Also it might be relevant to remember that Gall was writing back in the 70s. I&#x27;m pretty sure there strikes were a lot more frequent back then.<p>You can replace the trash collection example with the US federal taxation system if the details of the trash example are distracting. Think of all the ways that the taxation system is set up to push against its own clear goal of collecting tax revenue. It&#x27;s not really about explaining why it is that way, the most profound insight for me is this curiously common phenomenon of a system opposing its own purpose.

I struggle to understand how cobra and rat cases are &quot;institutions trying to preserve the problem&quot;.<p>Cobra effect, in particular, is an immensely interesting topic of how rewarding the metrics can distort the system, otherwise known as Goodhart&#x27;s effect. I highly recommend reading these two papers on the subject for anyone interested:<p>- Categorizing Variants of Goodhart&#x27;s Law [1]<p>- Building less-flawed metrics: Understanding and creating better measurement and incentive systems [2]<p>Adding the &quot;Cognitive Surplus&quot; book to the to-do shelf, but it seems like Shirky principle is mostly about institutions and the nature of bureaucracies. Now, a good question would be - when and why Shirky principle does not apply to the institutions. My first thought is the difference between bureaucracies that have &quot;owner&quot; and ones who lost it.<p>When a bureaucracy has an owner (person or group of people) who can change the bureaucracy in response to external events, then it&#x27;s probably unlikely to have Shirky effect (WHO and smallpox example in comments). However, bureaucracies that have lost their owner will most likely have this effect.<p>The best thing I read on this subject (how bureaucracies work) is Samo Burja&#x27;s &quot;Great Founder Theory&quot; [3]. If anyone can suggest something along these lines on the fundamental principles of bureaucracies, I would appreciate a lot.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1803.04585" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1803.04585</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S2666389923002210" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S266638992...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;samoburja.com&#x2F;gft&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;samoburja.com&#x2F;gft&#x2F;</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="39496307" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39496307" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">TaurenHunter</span><span>|</span><a href="#39492671">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39497557">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39496307">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39496307">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Reminds me of a recent post about getting a message in Slack with a link to another app about a meeting in Zoom, ... and a number of steps involving a bunch of other apps each costing $15&#x2F;month&#x2F;user.

A problem is every opportunity for a solution. Uber existed to address the limited amount of taxis in a city and address the pricing problem they produce. How they themselves became more expensive, they also became more of a problem. Then more solutions were added like regulation...<p>The issues are compounding. The phrase is, &quot;The road to hell is paved with good intentions.&quot;.<p>A good example is also how some open-source business models moved away and started charing their services. The unintentional consequences of society and businesses making descissions hastedly would out throughly reviewing and executing their strategy.<p>Often businesses that make these underhanded tactics receive massive negative publicity and loss. A good example is how Unity announced that it will start charging per installation of a users game. This became problematic because in turn it was taking an already fairly licensed product and tacting on additional fees which caused it to become unfairly priced. Their initial goal as a platform for game development was to be the better competition to major studios eventually becoming the problem they swore not to be after becoming established.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
