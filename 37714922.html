They also diminish the &#x27;work&#x27; in the transaction (which overcomes the threshold to make blocks) by adding hops - so it&#x27;s only worth it to add hops in order to &#x27;win the race.&#x27; All nodes in the path have an expected value on the fee, but the further into the chain of hops, the more that diminishes.<p>In a technical sense, it isn&#x27;t necessary to then reward those routing nodes to keep the anti-Sybil property for the routing network itself, but it does give other nice properties related to trustlessness and network provision.<p>1. Data pays no fees, routers get no rewards<p>Assuming data is published to a shared medium which requires some threshold of &quot;work&quot; which stems from the data, then even just the act of including that data into your medium becomes more difficult the more hops it accumulates. You then of course rely on trust assumptions to fight spam.<p>2. Data pays fees, routers get no rewards<p>If you use some measure of cost to create data, you can handle spam, and that cost determines how much work the data carries with it and thus how likely it is to be included into the medium (trying to be very general here, but in the linked article that medium <i>is</i> a blockchain).

Is it now a cryptographically secure system or was it just revised until it was cryptographically secure against <i>review</i>?<p>That&#x27;s very much the history of POS systems but it&#x27;s even worse than that, because as the revisions went they added new conditions to the assumed security model so at the end of the day the security assumptions are very different from where they started. They might be secure but for example a function whose security definition is that whatever the function does it correct is always &quot;secure&quot;. :P<p>There is one prominent POS cryptocurrency (I&#x27;ll not name it because it&#x27;s not relevant and naming it will just invoke vicious shills) which has a formal security proof that starts with the assumption that all participants have a network that faithfully delivers all messages without loss and in the same order.  It&#x27;s trivial to have a consensus system that is secure in that model because you don&#x27;t even need a consensus system in that model: &quot;first transaction out of any competing set wins&quot; is an adequate policy, the network in that case is equivalent to a consensus system.  (Maybe the system provides some useful security properties, but its security proof won&#x27;t tell you anything about them)<p>In any case we&#x27;re largely in violent agreement. I think.<p>While I can agree with your argument that some of the friction in these systems may have practical utility even if it doesn&#x27;t meet a strong security criteria, the danger that worries me is that people don&#x27;t actually have a clear mental model for what they do provide or what risks they have.  This may lead them to expose themselves in ways that they wouldn&#x27;t if the properties were better known, and ultimately result in losses greater than the benefits.<p>Or maybe not: lots of things work fine on fully centralized systems, or works fine even when their security rests on no one bothering to attack.

Saito&#x27;s mechanism rewards nodes for efficiently routing transactions to block producers, thus making Sybil attacks less lucrative. This is further illustrated with mathematical proof and examples comparing honest and Sybil behaviors, highlighting how the expected rewards change in both scenarios .</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
