The first one worthy of the name was for train dispatching. That was General Railway Signal&#x27;s NX (eNtry-Exit) system.[1] Introduced in 1936, still in use in the New York subways. With NX, the dispatcher routing an approaching train selected the &quot;entry&quot; track on which the train was approaching. The system would then light up all possible &quot;exit&quot; tracks from the junction. This took into account conflicting routes already set up and trains present in the junction. Only reachable exits lit up. The dispatcher pushed the button for the desired exit. The route setup was then automatic. Switches moved and locked into position, then signals along the route went to clear. All this was fully interlocked; the operator could not request anything unsafe.<p>There were control panels before this, but this was the first system where the UI did more than just show status. It actively advised and helped the operator. The operator set the goal; the system worked out how to achieve it.<p>Another one I encountered was an early computerized fire department dispatching system. Big custom display boards and keyboards. When an alarm came in, it was routed to a dispatcher. Based on location, the system picked the initial resources (trucks, engines, chiefs, and special equipment) to be dispatched. Each dispatcher had a custom keyboard, with one button for each of those resources. The buttons lit up indicating the selected equipment. The dispatcher could add additional equipment with a single button push, if the situation being called in required it. Then they pushed one big button, which set off alarms in fire stations, printed a message on a printer near the fire trucks, and even opened the doors at the fire house. There was a big board at the front of the room which showed the status of everything as colored squares. The fire department people said this cut about 30 seconds off a dispatch, which, in that business, is considered a big win.<p>Both of those are systems which had to work right. Large language models are not even close to being safe to use in such applications. Until LLMs report &quot;don&#x27;t know&quot; instead of hallucinating, they&#x27;re limited to very low risk applications such as advertising and search.<p>Now, the promising feature of LLMs in this direction is the ability to use the context of previous questions and answers. It&#x27;s still query&#x2F;response, but with enough context that the user can gradually make the system converge on a useful result. Such systems are useful for &quot;I don&#x27;t know what I want but I&#x27;ll know it when I see it&quot; problems. This allows using flaky LLMs with human assistance to get a useful result.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;online.anyflip.com&#x2F;lbes&#x2F;vczg&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;#p=1" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;online.anyflip.com&#x2F;lbes&#x2F;vczg&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;#p=1</a></div><br/><div id="36397136" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36397136" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">philovivero</span><span>|</span><a href="#36396484">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36401320">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36397136">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36397136">[16 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Both of those are systems which had to work right.

Civilization is, arguably, one big exercise in reducing variance in individuals, as low variance and high predictability is what lets us work together and trust each other, instead of seeing each other as threats and hiding from each other (or trying to preemptively attack). The more something or someone is unpredictable, the more we see it or them as a threat.<p>&gt; <i>(separation of powers, bicameralism, &quot;democracy&quot;, bureaucracy, regulations, etc).</i><p>And on the more individual scale: culture, social customs and public school system are all forces that shape humans from the youngest age, reducing variance in thoughts and behaviors. Exams of all kind, including psychological ones, prevent high-variance individuals from being able to do large amount of harm to others. The higher the danger, the higher the bar.<p>There are tests you need to pass to be able to own and drive a car. There are tests you may need to pass to own a firearm. There are more tests still before you&#x27;ll be allowed to fly an aircraft. Those tests are not there just to ensure your skills - they also filter high-variance individuals, people who cannot be safely given responsibility to operate dangerous tools.<p>Further still, the society has mechanisms to eliminate high-variance outliers. Lighter cases may get some kind of medical or spiritual treatment, and (with gates in place to keep them away from guns and planes) it works out OK. More difficult cases eventually get locked up in prisons or mental hospitals. While there are lot of specific things to discuss about the prison and mental care systems, their general, high-level function is simple: they keep both predictably dangerous and high-variance (i.e. unpredictably dangerous) people stashed safely away, where they can&#x27;t disrupt or harm others at scale.<p>&gt; <i>We might not fully understand why, but we&#x27;ve found methods that sorta kinda &quot;work&quot;.</i><p>Yes, we&#x27;ve found many such methods at every level - individual, familial, tribal, national - and we stack them all on top of each other. This creates the conditions that let us live in larger groups, with less conflicts, as well as to safely use increasingly powerful (i.e. potentially destructive) technologies.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36397649" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36397649" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ilyt</span><span>|</span><a href="#36396484">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36397136">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36398184">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36397201">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36397649">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36397649">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;Because humans, even some of the most humble, will still assert things they THINK are true, but are patently untrue, based on misunderstandings, faulty memories, confused reasoning, and a plethora of others.<p>&gt; I can&#x27;t count the number of times I&#x27;ve had conversations with extremely well-experience, smart techies who just spout off the most ignorant stuff.<p>Spouting out the most ignorant stuff is one of the lowest risk things you can do in general.

In terms of the logic of UI mechanics, what about mobile is different? Sure gestures and touch UI bring a kind of difference. Still, from the standpoint of cognition, desktop and mobile UIs have fundamentally the same cognitive dynamics. Command line UIs make you remember conmands by heart, GUIs make you select from a selection offered to you but they still do not undestand your intention.

Tab completion on many CLIs is good enough that I&#x27;m often frustrated when the tab key isn&#x27;t the &#x27;do what I&#x27;m thinking&#x27; button.  And whenever browsers change their predictive text algorithms so I need to type more than three letters of a URL for it to complete, I get annoyed because I&#x27;m so used to the predictor knowing what I want.

Your mouse is a tool, and you use it to interface with objects and things, and through special software it can become a more specialized tool (word processors, spreadsheets, graphic design software, etc).  You aren’t issuing commands, you’re manipulating a digital environment with tools.<p>Which is why the notion of conversational AI (or whatever dumb name they came up with for the “third paradigm”) seems kind of alien to me.  I mean, I definitely see its utility, but I find it hard to imagine it being as dominant as some are arguing it could be.  Any task that involves browsing for information seems like more of an object manipulation task.  Any task involving some kind of visual design seems like a tool manipulation task, unless you aren’t too picky about the final result.<p>Ultimately I think conversational UI is best suited not for tasks, but services.  Granted, the line between the two can be fuzzy at times.  If you’re looking for a website, but you don’t personally know anything about making a website, then that task morphs into a service that someone or something else does.<p>Which I suppose is kind of the other reason why I find the idea kind of alien.  I almost never use the computer for services.  I use it to browse, to create, to work, all of which entail something more intuitively suited to object or tool manipulation.</div><br/><div id="36397437" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36397437" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rzzzt</span><span>|</span><a href="#36397115">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36400103">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36397437">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36397437">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">AutoCAD and Rhino 3D are two examples that I remember having a command prompt sitting proudly somewhere at the bottom of the UI.
