It was an e-commerce search engine on products listed on Shopify shops (sound familiar?  :)).  At the time, we had &gt; 100m products listed, and I don&#x27;t remember how many shops we were indexing.. over 100k I think, but we had access to over a million.  Overall, I think your approach is very similar to ours, but we managed to keep our costs lower.  At the time, we were spending ~$550&#x2F;mo, and our search times were under 300ms.  We had established partnerships with a number of shops, and we had a few users, but not nearly enough.  That&#x27;s where the wheels came off.  The site operated for over a year, but the monthly costs wore us down until we finally decided to pull the plug.<p>I still maintain that this is a good idea, and constantly have to fight off the urge to &quot;try again&quot;, however, to do it properly, I think funding would be necessary, or finding some way to organically gain a lot of users.<p>Looking back, there are things I could have done to reduce my opex further, but in the end, it still wouldn&#x27;t have mattered if I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to acquire users.</div><br/><div id="38638642" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38638642" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">DeathArrow</span><span>|</span><a href="#38637451">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38637554">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38638642">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38638642">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;but in the end, it still wouldn&#x27;t have mattered if I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to acquire users<p>In EU there are many price comparison engines with millions or billions of products. I don&#x27;t know how popular they are. Some monetize trough ads, some have partnership with stores and you can buy directly from the search results.<p>I generally search first on the local Amazon equivalent, if I don&#x27;t like what I see, I search on a smaller store. If I still can&#x27;t find or dislike the products or prices I search Google. If I am still not contended with the results, I will go search on comparison engines.<p>And I also have a browser extension called Pricy who polls the comparison engines, so once I land in a product page I know which store has the better price and what was the price history through last year.<p>Probably many people have similar patterns. I expect people in US to search Amazon first, if it&#x27;s not a very niche product they are after.<p>I think you can have a better monetization proposal, if instead of just search you build a sales platform, so people can directly buy after searching, without hoping to various websites.</div><br/><div id="38639266" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38639266" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">berkes</span><span>|</span><a href="#38637451">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38638642">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38639015">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38639266">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38639266">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Unfortunately many of these &quot;comparison&quot; websites have a businesses model built on affiliate fees.<p>It doesn&#x27;t take much imagination to predict which products show up as &quot;best&quot; or &quot;cheapest&quot;.<p>And the fairer ones have to keep playing cat and mouse with shops lowering pricing when they detect a scraper coming by.

You could add a BUY NOW button to your site without forcing the user to navigate the original site or checkout flow. Example:

Mices is pretty good. I did not go there this year but I know some of the people behind it. Good community and lots of stuff happening.<p>Two points here.<p>- 25 million is really not a lot for most search engines. Something like Elasticsearch can easily deal with that if you deal with it properly. And there are plenty of equally capable solutions. I have worked with logging clusters that processes log entries by those numbers on a daily basis. A modestly sized cluster goes a long way for that. Bare metal is cheaper than cloud for this. But a couple of simple servers with decent CPUs and memory and SSDs should go a long way here. Start worrying once you hit a few hundred GB of storage used. Anything below that is easy to deal with.<p>- The key challenge with this volume is not performance but search quality. Building a competitive search engine is hard. You might have thousands of potential matches out of millions for any given query and your job is to pick the best 3, 5, 10 (whatever fits on your screen) ones. This is hard.<p>So, what makes for a good answer is the key question to answer. All the naive solutions for this problem put you at the bottom of the market in terms of competitiveness. If you can&#x27;t do better, you are just another low quality search engine not quite solving the problem.

It is better to do search using those as well.<p>Both are pretty cheap and can be done reliably within 20-30 lines of code each in python. 3rd party tools for these are pretty stable.</div><br/><div id="38636625" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38636625" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pencildiver</span><span>|</span><a href="#38636376">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38636538">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38636625">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38636625">[16 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Great suggestions, looking into this right now. First time building something like this so definitely new to some of these tools.<p>For scraping: Found that every Shopify store has a public JSON file that is available in the same route. The JSON file appears on the [Base URL]&#x2F;products.json. For example, the store for Wild Fox has their JSON file available here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wildfox.com&#x2F;products.json" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wildfox.com&#x2F;products.json</a>.<p>Built a crawler in simple Javascript to run through a list that I bought on a site called &quot;Built With&quot;, access their JSON file with the product listing data, and scrape the exact data we want for Agora. Then storing it in Mongo and, currently, using Mongo Atlas Search (i.e. saw they released Vector Search but haven&#x27;t looked at it). It has been a process of trial and error to pick the right data fields that are required for the front-end experience but not wanting to increase the size of the data set drastically. And after initially using React, switched to NextJS to make it easier to structure URLs of each product listing page.<p>Mongo will run me about $1,500 &#x2F; month at the current CPU level. AWS all in will be about $700. I&#x27;m currently not storing the image files, so that reduces the cost as well.<p>A few improvement that has helped so far:<p>- Having 2 separate Search Indexes, one for the &#x27;brand&#x27; and on for the &#x27;product&#x27;. There&#x27;s a second public JSON file that is available on all Shopify stores with relevant store data at [Base URL]&#x2F;meta.json For example: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wildfox.com&#x2F;meta.json" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wildfox.com&#x2F;meta.json</a><p>- Removing the &quot;tags&quot; that are provided by store owners on Shopify. I believe these are placed for SEO reasons. These were 1 - 50 words &#x2F; product so removing these reduced the data size we&#x27;re dealing with. The tradeoff is that they can&#x27;t be used to improve the search experience now.<p>Hope this helps. Still wrapping my head around all of this.</div><br/><div id="38638505" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38638505" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wolfgang42</span><span>|</span><a href="#38636376">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38636625">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38637076">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38638505">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38638505">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I’ll second the comments that $2k&#x2F;month is <i>alarmingly</i> high, especially for the performance that you seem to be getting.

1. When clicking &quot;Open&quot; on a product, the user should be able to open that in a separate tab. Currently that&#x27;s not possible; I&#x27;m sure because it&#x27;s being delivered in a single page (can&#x27;t check now because you&#x27;re getting hugged to death by HN).<p>2. When the server&#x27;s slow, as it just was, there should be some kind of waiter &#x2F; loader to immediately show the user that the &quot;Open&quot; click was sent on a product. Otherwise people will keep clicking it (or worse, clicking other products) and there&#x27;s no indication that it&#x27;s loading.<p>3. Once a product is open, it&#x27;s not clear how to get back from it. I see the &quot;X&quot; in the corner, but doing that seems to take me back to a blank search page, not to my search results. The back button also doesn&#x27;t take me back to the search results...</div><br/><div id="38636821" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38636821" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pencildiver</span><span>|</span><a href="#38636698">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38637639">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38636821">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38636821">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks for sharing this!
