The average degree of separation[0] is going to be less than 2; I&#x27;d bet excluding a few outliers and wannabes[1], the <i>maximum</i> degree of separation will be 2. Meaning, if you&#x27;re upper class, everyone else in upper class is either your acquaintance, or an acquaintance of your acquaintance. At that scale, the informal social mechanisms reign supreme. They may be influenced or channeled by the formal system of laws, but they&#x27;re not replaced by it.<p>(Note that this isn&#x27;t the &quot;lowest&quot; &#x2F; most implicit level of group mechanics. Upper classes tend to have codes of conduct, etiquette, honor codes, etc. That&#x27;s the consequence of size and weak binding of the group. The average degree of separation is still greater than 1, and even those you know directly, you may not hang around with much - so you need <i>some</i> structure to boost the implicit, informal social self-regulation mechanism. In a way, those upper classes sit at the intermediate point between early, small human tribes, and organized societies that came later.)<p>Conversely, if you&#x27;re poor, you&#x27;re in a <i>huge</i> social class, and your social interactions are dominated by those with total strangers. Average degree of separation is above 2, probably above 3. You&#x27;re almost always dealing with strangers who themselves are also almost always dealing with strangers, and most of the time those dealings are effectively one-off - you have one interaction with a random person, and then neither of you are likely to ever cross paths again[2].<p>The point I&#x27;m getting at is that most people in the modern world have a large amount of one-off, transactional interactions with others. Such interactions are too brief and too weak to allow for bonds to form - and without that, there&#x27;s little in terms of mutual obligations, or mutual care. What you get is the baseline &quot;stranger treatment&quot;.<p>This is not to justify the conduct of people taking advantage of others, knowingly or not. I&#x27;m just saying that at this scale, all most of us can expect is the baseline &quot;stranger treatment&quot;. Money isn&#x27;t the direct cause here - the <i>scale</i> of our societies is. Money is merely what allows societies to scale this far, and it shouldn&#x27;t be blamed for problems that are problems of scale.<p>As for the &quot;common phenomenon of well-heeled individuals knowingly preying upon lower classes&quot; - that is indeed a challenge, because at this scale, implicit social defenses (like people having reputation and getting shunned if it gets too bad) don&#x27;t work. The options we have instead are more difficult to use and slow-acting - teaching people empathy, promoting a more benevolent culture, and adjusting laws to discourage bad behavior. It works well for many things, not quite well for others, and takes a lot of time to adjust - but again, consequences of scale.<p>--<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Six_degrees_of_separation" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Six_degrees_of_separation</a><p>[1] - And geography. E.g. the upper class in Poland and in Germany may know each other well, but they might have few direct connections to upper class in e.g. South Korea. But that&#x27;s just because they rarely deal with each other, and thus doesn&#x27;t impact the thrust of my argument.<p>[2] - To this, too, there are degrees. Consider us here specifically - you and me. We&#x27;re both aware of each other, crossed paths on HN many times over the years - but those interactions are infrequent and inconsequential enough that we aren&#x27;t much more than strangers to each other. We may be nice to each other, and I do consider you wise, but we aren&#x27;t really taking each other into account during our daily lives.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36690711" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36690711" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">CraigJPerry</span><span>|</span><a href="#36687128">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36688938">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36690756">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36690711">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36690711">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;&gt; Before we reliably had money, we had barter<p>As far as i know there’s no evidence for this.

On the other hand, single-step trading - that is, barter - gets infeasible as the primary trading model <i>very quickly</i>. Not because of specialization (the &quot;I want to trade shoes for food, but everyone already has enough shoes&quot; problem), but because of <i>fairness</i> - everyone&#x27;s memory and the &quot;shared knowledge&quot; established through gossip can scale only so far, and past that point, you need some other means to ensure exchange of goods and services stays balanced over time (and that your group can agree fair balance is being maintained).<p>Basically, either your proto-society develops ways to track balance of trade[0], or it&#x27;ll grow a freeloader problem, which will keep it down and possibly even destroy the group. That point comes early enough that it&#x27;s entirely likely the early societies that didn&#x27;t develop money didn&#x27;t grow large enough, and didn&#x27;t survive long enough, to enter historical record.<p>--<p>[0] - Trading via a medium of exchange - that is, some form of money - is just one way to achieve it, but it has the useful property of being self-balancing, thus not requiring shared global state. That is, you don&#x27;t have to keep official logs of every trade made by everyone in your group to keep things fair and balanced (or even define, update and defend what &quot;fair&quot; and &quot;balanced&quot; means, which is something everyone has slightly different view of) - you can just establish a common medium of exchange, give people freedom to individually negotiate the exchange rates, and you have a self-balancing system.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36690756" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36690756" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dragonwriter</span><span>|</span><a href="#36687128">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36690711">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36691165">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36690756">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36690756">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Before we reliably had money, we had barter and &quot;mutual aid.&quot;<p>That’s a reasonable supposition at the most primitive level, but there’s not really evidence for that <i>especially</i> the former, as attractive as the conjectured barter =&gt; money narrative is.<p>Its quite possible that the actual chain is non-exchange mutual support (“mutual aid” is a specific fairly modern concept that may not be a good model) =&gt; explicit quid-pro-quo with money =&gt; barter as a fallback when money fails and until a new currency is adopted by convention.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36691165" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36691165" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jazzyjackson</span><span>|</span><a href="#36687128">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36690756">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36688698">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36691165">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36691165">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Nah, humans work the same as we always have: we become indebted to each other.<p>Cash is this wacky invention by which we cancel debt, specifically so we don&#x27;t owe each other anything, relationship over, see you later, don&#x27;t @ me.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36688698" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36688698" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ajross</span><span>|</span><a href="#36687128">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36691165">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36688275">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36688698">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36688698">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Before we reliably had money [...] Now [...] A lot of people no longer seem to understand the implicit social contract behind<p>Nah.
