Finally there is some movement on making Google Docs better.<p>I haven&#x27;t used the feature, but from reading the blog post it is sad to see how poorly Google executes on products, even at the beta stage.<p>Some context:<p>I&#x27;ve built such a product before and eSigs are more simple than they seem as long as you do a few things. 1) You need to verify somebody&#x27;s identity. Sending them an email with the request is a valid way of doing this. 2) You need to make the final signed document easily accessible (e.g. emailing all parties a copy of the signed document. 3) You need to not obscure what the person is signing (they need to be able to easily see the entire document if they wish) 4) You need to make it possible for all parties to verify the validity of a signature, which is done with an audit trail appended to the back of the document. 5) Some types of contracts are not valid to be signed with eSign. 6) The parties need to agree to do business electronically, but this is mostly up to them.<p>You do not need to create fake wet signatures, cryptographically sign a document, or do encryption beyond what is necessary for normal compliance. Those are all UX or marketing features: they don&#x27;t hurt, just that according to experts I have spoken to, they aren&#x27;t a factor when going to court.<p>And then we have what Google is offering:<p>From the screenshots, I think it is only a fake wet signature.  I&#x27;m not sure how valid that is.<p>Apparently you cannot ask for an eSignature from non-Gmail users right now. But how are you supposed to know they are Gmail users? Can Google not send people a simple email with a link? This alone makes the feature almost worthless, and for something that seems so trivial.<p>They also said they will only be adding an audit trail later this year. This is really sketchy because I believe it means you, nor anybody else can actually verify if it has been signed. Again, this is quite trivial: you store the audit trail in a database, and you append the log as pages onto the back of the PDF document.</div><br/><div id="37082029" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37082029" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">crazygringo</span><span>|</span><a href="#37080227">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37080847">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37082029">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37082029">[13 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>Finally there is some movement on making Google Docs better.</i><p>I just find these comments to be so strange.

It&#x27;s a lot of stuff.<p>Maybe they&#x27;re not features that matter to you, some are available only to paid customers as opposed to free tier, or maybe you just haven&#x27;t bothered to even notice.

Electronic signature: this is basically something that puts a distinguishing mark on a file.<p>2. Advanced electronic signature: these use cryptography according to the specifications set out in the regulation, but anyone can make them. There are some requirements about how a person’s identity is linked to their signature.<p>3. Qualified electronic signature: these are advanced electronic signatures which have been produced with a recognised trust service provider. Each country has a list of trust service providers, and each other country mutually recognises their trust lists.<p>It is a bit more detailed than that, but in general, simple transactions can pretty much use any electronic signature (but this varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The uk generally doesn’t need anything fancier than docusign).

I totally agree with the parent comment: having an e-signature product that is only usable by other Gmail users (and of course their is really no way to know if any particular email address is a Gmail user) makes it useless. What, so if I need some docs signed I&#x27;ll get half of them signed with DocuSign and the other half with Docs? Of course not, I&#x27;ll just use the product that works with anyone.<p>Google used to have this same &quot;can only share docs with other Drive users&quot; feature, though it&#x27;s improved somewhat. In general I think the enterprise doc sharing features are so bad in Drive that the only way I can wrap my head around it is to think that Google is scared of antitrust concerns if they too closely tried to emulate features from the likes of Dropbox, Box and others.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37080843" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37080843" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nextos</span><span>|</span><a href="#37080227">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37080587">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37080733">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37080843">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37080843">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Finally there is some movement on making Google Docs better.<p>Recently, they have also improved the UI on Google Docs and Gmail making it much less laggy.<p>On my old NUC computer, it makes a big difference.<p>It seems that middle-management is becoming a bit less sclerotic.</div><br/><div id="37082056" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37082056" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ec109685</span><span>|</span><a href="#37080227">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37080843">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37080733">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37082056">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37082056">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Chrome improvements might be helping there too.</div><br/><div id="37082143" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37082143" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nextos</span><span>|</span><a href="#37080227">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37082056">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37080733">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37082143">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37082143">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Maybe, but this is something I experienced on Firefox ESR.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="37080733" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37080733" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ct520</span><span>|</span><a href="#37080227">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37080843">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37085030">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37080733">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37080733">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As someone that consults in this space I more or less agree with you.

This means that it&#x27;s almost always worth using a built-in feature of software you already have, than going for external software. Add to this the fact that companies almost never have one company account, each team re-buys the same software because services are hard, and the fact that most companies already use DocuSign matters a bit less.<p>Much of Slack&#x27;s growth has been built on this[^1]. You can sign up for a free account and start inviting your immediate team. Paying for a small team is well under the typical auto-approved expenses limit, and when you&#x27;ve sunk your cost, got a bunch of people onboard, and proved the value, only then do you go to IT to get it rolled out across the business.<p>Individuals using this sort of thing, termed &quot;shadow IT&quot;, is a good way to grow usage. This feature of docs seems well positioned to grow that way even if DocuSign is available.<p>[^1]: I worked on a team that was required by the business to use MS Teams.
