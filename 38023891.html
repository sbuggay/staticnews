I&#x27;m biased though because my own takes on how things should evolve were very similar. I was however completely unsuccessful in getting those ideas into production! And that, that is a huge deal. Through out my career it has been interesting to meet people with great ideas and then they are unable to get them into production, and when the idea does come into production everyone feels like &quot;Wow, this is so obvious why didn&#x27;t we do it sooner?&quot; and some folks are banging their head against the wall :-).<p>One of the more interesting discussions I had during my tenure at Google was about the &quot;size&quot; of the unit of clusters. If you toured Google you got the whole &quot;millions of cheap replaceable computers&quot; mantra. Sitting in Building 42 was a &quot;rack&quot; which had cheap PC motherboards on &quot;pizza dishes&quot; without all that superfluous sheet metal. Bunches of these in a rack and a festoon of network cables. What are the &quot;first class&quot; elements of these machines? Compute? Networking? Storage? Did you replace components? Or a whole &quot;pizza slice&quot; (which Google called an &#x27;index&#x27; at the time). Really a great systems analysis problem.<p>FWIW I&#x27;m more of a &quot;chunk&quot; guy (which is the direction 0xide went) and less of a &quot;cluster&quot; guy (which is the way Google organized their infrastructure). A lot of people associated with 0xide are folks I worked with at Sun in the early days and during that period the first hints of &quot;beowulf&quot; clusters vs &quot;super computers&quot;, was memory one thing (UMA) or did it vary from place to place (NUMA). I have a paper I wrote from that time about &quot;compute viscosity&quot; where the effective compute rate (which at the time largely focused on transactional databases) scaled up with resource (more memory more transactions&#x2F;sec for example) and scaled down with viscosity (higher latencies to get to state meant fewer transactions&#x2F;sec) Sun was invested heavily in the TPC-C benchmarks at the time but they were just one load pattern one could optimize for.<p>These guys have capitalized on all that history and it is fucking amazing! I just hope they don&#x27;t get killed by acquisition[1].<p>[1] KbA is a technique where people who are invested in the status quo and have resources available use those resources to force the investors in a disruptive technology to sell to them and then they quietly bury the disruptive technology.</div><br/><div id="38034708" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38034708" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mgh95</span><span>|</span><a href="#38024108">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38030056">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38038015">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38034708">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38034708">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Can you clarify a bit on what you mean by &quot;chunk&quot; guy?

In what I think of as classic systems architecture you&#x27;ve got a &#x27;store&#x27; (storage), &#x27;state&#x27; (memory), &#x27;threads&#x27; (computation), and &#x27;interconnect&#x27; (fabrics). In the 90&#x27;s a lot of folks focused on fabrics (Cray, Connection Machine, Sun, etc) somewhat on threads (compute blades), and state came along for the ride. How these systems were composed was always a big thing, then along came the first Beowulf clusters that used off the shelf motherboards (a &quot;chunk&quot; of threads&#x2F;state&#x2F;store) with a generic fabric (Ethernet). Originally NASA showed that you could do some highly parallel processing on these sorts of systems and Larry and Sergei at Stanford applied it to the process of internet search.<p>Collectively you have a &#x27;system resource&#x27; and with software you can make it look like anything you want. When you do compute with it, its performance becomes a function of its systems balance and the demands of the workload. Its all computer sciencey and yes there is a calculus to it. This isn&#x27;t something that most people dive into (or are even interested in[1]) but it was one of the things that captured my imagination early on as an engineer. I was consumed with questions like what was the difference between a microprocessor, a mini-computer, a workstation, and a mainframe? Why do they each exist? What does one do that they other can&#x27;t? Things like that.<p>[1] At Google I worked in what they called &#x27;Platforms&#x27; early on and clearly <i>most</i> of the company didn&#x27;t really care about the ins and outs of the systems bigtable&#x2F;gfs&#x2F;spanner&#x2F;etc ran on, they just wanted APIs to call. But they also didn&#x27;t care about utilization or costs. By the time I left some folks had just figured out (and one guy was building his career on) the fact that utilization directly affected operational costs. They still hadn&#x27;t started thinking about non-uniform rack configurations for different workloads.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="38038015" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38038015" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">TheRealDunkirk</span><span>|</span><a href="#38024108">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38030056">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38034708">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38027222">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38038015">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38038015">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I just hope they don&#x27;t get killed by acquisition.<p>Private equity in the US has collectively determined that no company shall exist outside of investment ownership.

Making sense is about cost and non-cost needs like data gravity and regulatory issues.<p>The cost case only works for GPU heavy workloads which this isn’t - wrong chassis, wrong network, etc.<p>Tofino2 is the wrong choice because even when they made that choice it would have been clear that it’s doa. Intel networking has not been a success center in, well, ever. That’s a selection that could only have been made for nerd reasons and not sensible business goals alignment or risk mitigation.<p>When you make an integrated solution you’d better be the best or close to the best at everything. This does not seem to be the best at anything. I will grant that it is elegant and largely nicer than the hyper converged story from other vendors but in practical terms this is the 2000s era rack scale VxBlock from Cisco or whatever Dell or HPE package today.

Choose any layer of abstraction and start picking at it and you’ll find mostly gaffer tape. Scaling up sucks. Rewriting old monoliths to micro services wasn’t a panacea except maybe for cloud vendor profits. You said the hardware market is well defined, which is another way of saying ossified. Particularly when you start comparing it to the expected pace of software. How’s Open19 going? How much  liquid cooling do you have in customer racks?<p>In my opinion this is ultimately a software offering that happens to come on vertically integrated hardware. It offers a complete, highly polished API to a minuscule-scale
DC. If they can find market fit and make a little bit of money, the next step is to start making deep improvements to things behind the abstraction. From where you sit, you are well aware that you could make huge improvements inside the DC demarc if you could do it without disrupting customers. But you’re probably limited by the terrible, terrible APIs you would be forced to use, that don’t offer the capabilities you need, from vendors who would be happy to chat but would provide timeframes in the 6-18
month range for even a modest improvement.<p>So this, IMO, is about defining that interface to a DC on a single hardware platform with vertical integration, and then scaling up from there. The current hyperscalers will adopt the suite of APIs and capabilities directly, make lower quality copies, or die.<p>Of course all assuming they’re successful enough to get the revenue machine going in the first place which seems likely to me, given the absolute dogshit state of the cloud world today, the trend towards multi cloud, and the business case for moving certain loads back on prem or to a bare metal colo++ offering.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38033229" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38033229" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lucideer</span><span>|</span><a href="#38025440">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38034309">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38031211">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38033229">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38033229">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>you obviously want your DCs as standardized as possible.

Memory safety is important, sure, but these systems aren’t usually ever allocating memory or taking actions that aren’t deterministic. PLCs usually operate in <i>strict realtime</i> environments. Like each operation contains a known number of clock cycles, and is timed to match physical “stuff” moving in the real world. To rewrite in rust, you’d need a flavor of rust where you can deterministically know the timing of ops and calibrate the timing of each branch of any control paths.<p>That said, there is a market for softer realtime PLCs and companies like Rockwell sell Windows IoT hardware- but they still contain a strict-realtime companion controller. Arduino is now selling a mountable PLC that can be programmed using their tools, but even they support traditional PLC programming languages.</div><br/><div id="38043731" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38043731" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cashsterling</span><span>|</span><a href="#38027898">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38033135">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38032443">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38043731">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38043731">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yep... I programmed PLC&#x27;s for periods of my career.  I could write about this until my fingers fall off, but in short:<p>Rust and C code can also operate in strict real-time embedded environments provided some basic rules are followed like &quot;no dynamic memory allocation&quot;. This done all the time.<p>If one follows hard real-time coding standards like Misra C or &quot;JPL real-time C&quot; (and these standards can also be applied to Rust, Zig, Ada, etc.) the code will run deterministically on a given target... just like PLC code running is not necessarily any more deterministic than C code (no dynamic allocation) running on an embedded processor.  In fact, many PLC&#x27;s today run a &quot;PLC code execution&quot; engine on top of a real-time operating system like QNX (which I think is mostly C code). Even in some older PLC&#x27;s, it is still C firmware that&#x27;s interpreting and running the PLC code.<p>PLC programming &quot;languages&quot; (ladder logic, FBD, CFC) were designed for their programming audience, who are not software engineers.  It is difficult to represent complex logic and numerical code in these languages and that limits the sophistication of algorithms that can be implemented on these systems. For instance: try writing a model predictive control routine in ladder logic; I think it could be done but I&#x27;d lose my remaining hair doing it.<p>PLC Structured Text is very similar to Pascal and pretty capable, but folks generally don&#x27;t write model predictive control algorithms in Structured Text either.<p>It is hard to orchestrate multiple PLC to run as a cohesive, deterministic unit.  The interfaces between PLC often need to be kept simple and sometime this communication is less real-time.  Things are a lot more advanced in cluster computing.<p>The limitations of current PLC architectures is already a pain point for complex control system, like large robotic manufacturing lines or optimal control of HVAC in large buildings)... and it&#x27;s going to get worse as performance demands increase.

A lot of businesses sell their old stuff, so you can pick up a generation or two out of date for a good price.

I want a proven vendor for my mission critical stuff.<p>I am sorry, I don&#x27;t see them addressing ANY of the real life pain points you have operating your own rack. Unless they ship a couple of data center engineers within the box.<p>The whole cloud stuff is simply designed for managers who believe that in a job market where it&#x27;s hard to find DC&#x2F;server engineers that things will be magically done in the background. With this, it&#x27;s worse - it&#x27;s pretended that &quot;stuff just works&quot; if you ship it in a single box. And that&#x27;s simply not a case. A DC installation not constantly maintained by skilled engineer will go down in flames within months, one way or another.</div><br/><div id="38034894" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38034894" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wpm</span><span>|</span><a href="#38034651">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38024331">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38034894">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38034894">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Many of your questions have answers in TFM: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.oxide.computer&#x2F;guides&#x2F;introduction" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.oxide.computer&#x2F;guides&#x2F;introduction</a></div><br/><div id="38035809" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38035809" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Fischgericht</span><span>|</span><a href="#38034651">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38034894">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38024331">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38035809">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38035809">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Part of the power distribution question is answered, in a way that gives even more concerns, though.

I setup several drills for each task involving various types of failures and how to manage them to the point that it was part of muscle memory.<p>Some drills I practiced were setting up RAID 10 and on hardware failure having an email sent to me, so I went through the process of getting RAID 10 working using 4 of the drives, and then I would physically pull a hard drive out of the system as it was running to simulate a failure, and then I swapped in a new hard drive and ensured that the RAID rebuild process took place.<p>Once I was confident enough, I went to thinkmate.com and bought two JBOD expansion chassis each of which supported 78 drives and filled each of them up with 5 TB Seagate drives to get a total of 390 TB. The JBODs are managed by a 1U server running Ubuntu Server and software RAID using mdadm. I also bought 8 compute servers that were considered high density and could fit in 4U. I got a Cisco router for Internet and I networked everything within the data center together using a used Infiniband switch that I bought off of ebay. I also got a KVM so I could remotely access all of the systems. If there&#x27;s one thing that I would change today, it would be to use ZFS.<p>I remember comparing the cost of doing this DIY setup to some other premade solutions like EMC and the cost was astronomical, like 3-4x what I ended up having to pay. I also even remember watching Linus Tech Tips and Level1Techs on Youtube and they both had good content about how they managed their storage that was fairly reasonable but still slightly on the pricey side, nevertheless I learned quite a bit from it.<p>At any rate, the bottom line is that it&#x27;s not trivial to learn all this stuff by any means and I remember having some serious frustrations due to just how bad and demoralizing some error messages can be, but it&#x27;s not thaaaat difficult either and in my situation my company is self funded, no venture capital or outside investors of any kind so every dollar my company spends is a dollar out of my own pocket.

At this point these racks are fairly standardized in terms of sizing and ancillary features.  These are built-out to solve the following:<p><pre><code>    * Physical space - The servers themselves require a certain amount of room and depending on the workloads assigned will need different dimensions.  These are specified in rack &quot;units&quot; (U) as the height dimension.  The width is fixed and depths can vary but are within a standard limit.  A rack might have something like 44U of total vertical space and each server can take anywhere from 1-4U generally.  Some equipment may even go up to 6U or 8U (or more).

    * Power - All rack equipment will require power so there are generally looms or wiring schemes to run all cabling and outlets for all powered devices in the rack.  For the most part this can be run on or in the post rails and remains hidden other than the outlet receptacles and mounted power strips.  This might also include added battery and power conditioning systems which will eat into your total vertical U budget.  Total rack power consumption is a vital figure.

    * Cooling - Most rack equipment will require some minimum amount of airflow or temperature range to operate properly.  Servers have fans but there will also be a need for airflow within the rack itself and you might have to solve unexpected issues such as temperature gradients from the floor to the ceiling of the rack.  Net heat output from workloads is a vital figure.

    * Networking - Since most rack equipment will be networked there are standard ways of cabling and patching in networks built into many racks.  This will include things such as bays for switches, some of which may eat into the vertical U budget.  These devices typically aggregate all rack traffic into a single higher-throughput network backplane that interconnects multiple racks into the broader network topology.

    * Storage - Depending on the workloads involved storage may be a major consideration and can require significant space (vertical Us), power, and cooling.  You will also need to take into account the bus interconnects between storage devices and servers.  This may also be delegated out into a SAN topology similar to a network where you have dedicated switches to connect to external storage networks.
</code></pre>
These are some of the major challenges with rack-mounted computing in a data center among many others.  What&#x27;s not really illustrated here is that since all of this has become so standardized we can now fully integrate these components directly rather than buying them piece-meal and installing them in a rack.<p>This is what Oxide has to offer.  They have built essentially an entire rack that solves the physical space, power, cooling, networking, and storage issues by simply giving you a turn-key box you plant in your data center and hook power and interconnects to.  In addition it is a fully integrated solution so they can capture a lot of efficiencies that would be hard or impossible in traditional design.<p>As someone with a lot of data center experience I am very excited to see this.  It is built by people with the correct attitude toward compute, imo.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38024097" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38024097" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">andrewstuart</span><span>|</span><a href="#38024061">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38024835">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38028981">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38024097">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38024097">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Weird there’s no mention of GPU at all when you’d think that’s what would prick up the ears of the hosting companies ….. stack a pile of GPUs in a rack, surely you can sell time on that.<p>The Oxide machines seem to be aimed at 2020.</div><br/><div id="38025109" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38025109" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">loudmax</span><span>|</span><a href="#38024061">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38024097">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38024142">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38025109">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38025109">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Oxide&#x27;s goal is that they, and by extension their customers, have as much visibility and control over the software stack in these racks as possible, and that includes firmware.  They started developing these systems before the current wave of interest in machine learning led by ChatGPU and Stable Diffusion really got underway.<p>Nvidia GPU drivers are very proprietary, which means that admins and developers have limited visibility into them if they misbehave in any way.  This goes against Oxide&#x27;s philosophy of full visibility into a system that you purchase.<p>Nvidia&#x27;s CUDA software has a significant lead ahead of AMD and Intel GPUs, and they&#x27;re not going to open source it any time soon.  But this is a rapidly changing landscape, and AMD and Intel and others are pouring an enormous amount of research into getting their hardware and software to match what Nvidia has going.  Nvidia is in pole position, but they&#x27;re not guaranteed to stay there.<p>There&#x27;s still a large market for the CPU workloads that Oxide is offering.  For now, Oxide will be concentrating on meeting this traditional compute demand.  But you&#x27;re right to point out that in 2023, the absence of a top tier GPU in these racks is noticeable.  I suspect Oxide will want to include some form of GPU or TPU into the next version of their system, but they won&#x27;t just grab whatever hardware happens to be in fashion.

With &quot;cloud&quot; people have grown comfortable papering over poor basic performance by abstracting away even your visibility into how a system is running. &quot;You don&#x27;t need to worry about that! It&#x27;s ~serverless~.&quot; But you&#x27;ll worry when that bill comes due at the end of the month.<p>With systems like Oxide, you are allowing users to once again actually see what they get, and ensure they get what they paid for, from a high-end cloud server.<p>It should be putting other systems providers on-notice that the days of flaky, non-performant, and poorly-integrated components are behind us. People want <i>beasts</i> from their servers.<p>And software designers, this is also your wake-up call that you can&#x27;t just put lousy-performing software with poor CPU utilization and memory hogging on big metal and hope that it&#x27;s &quot;good enough.&quot; You really need to design your software to run ~efficiently~ in such systems.</div><br/><div id="38030669" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38030669" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throwawaaarrgh</span><span>|</span><a href="#38030224">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38024695">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38030669">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38030669">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;  People might just look at it and say &quot;It&#x27;s just a rack of CPUs and storage.&quot; And I can only imagine just how much you might be tempted to throttle them<p>Lol.

Some followups:<p>1. Seems like you would need quite a bit of capital to be one of these integrator companies, to float the cash to buy land, build a facility and buy the racks. Does your own vs rent philosophy extend so far to also say that companies should also own the land and facility on and in which a server rack sits? Early on, Amazon talked about purpose-built datacenters being important, with huge power and internet connectivity requirements, earthquake&#x2F;fire&#x2F;flood protection and HVAC requirements. Sounds like the best way to go, if you have a huge amount of cash, seems like unit economics are now favoring data center costs in the billions of USD.<p>2. For now, would it make much sense to buy one or more of these and co-locate it with a cloud company&#x27;s existing facilities in an office building? Or, if you had some space in a &quot;good&quot; datacenter where you leased space and sublet space, connection, power and maintenance costs to your customers, would that reduce the friction for buying one of these? Or does that essentially defeat the purpose and advantage of owning your own racks? If you remove the price of renting the rack, what&#x27;s the ongoing cost to park one of these in an existing datacenter? Is that even an option?<p>3. From a purely mechanical perspective, the performance and efficiency advantages with liquid cooling vs. air cooling seem great. Seems like the problem is mostly around installation, maintenance, application requirements and reliability. Would be great to eventually see an integrated rack with liquid cooling plumbing hookups going directly to heat exchangers. At the cost of massively increased initial cost, maintenance cost, and with a built-in severe, catastrophic failure mode... Understood that this doesn&#x27;t really make sense if these racks are being put into existing air-cooled datacenters or office buildings, which seems like it&#x27;s going to be the case for awhile?<p>5. Too bad, seems like your prospective customers are in a similar sales funnel as people who want to rent capacity in a private cloud (and it&#x27;s always nice to be your own customer!) What prevents your competitors from also selling servers? Do you think that the reason that public cloud companies don&#x27;t sell servers is that they think their competitors will get ahold of the hardware and copy their technical advantages? Or is it that they have the deep pockets for building datacenters that their customers don&#x27;t necessarily have, and they would rather have monthly revenue anyways?</div><br/><div id="38044633" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38044633" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">steveklabnik</span><span>|</span><a href="#38033629">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38042351">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38033738">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38044633">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38044633">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For 1 and 2, to be honest, I don&#x27;t personally know much about all of that.
