Science got along fine for thousands of years without Journals and Conferences deciding what&#x27;s &quot;correct&quot; and not. It&#x27;s been a failed experiment. Journals started as a way to help distribute works to other researchers to improve upon the old method of just mailing it to one another. Arxiv is great for peer review. Your work is actually fucking available and not behind some pay wall, where your peers can... review it. Only thing would be better is if we were using OpenReview so we could track discussions, but I&#x27;ll admit that could get messy real quick as anyone that&#x27;s open sourced their research work will tell you (lots of questions like &quot;I trained my model, how do I test it?&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m getting a cuda out of memory error, how do I fix this?&quot;).<p>Arxiv&#x2F;preprints are peer review</div><br/><div id="36918267" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36918267" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">drtgh</span><span>|</span><a href="#36916455">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36916618">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36916759">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36918267">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36918267">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The important Journals have an strange business,<p>By one side the Journal reclaim a high amount of money for being able TO TRY to publish on them (APCs fee), more if one want to be published for to allow free access, as to read the publication in such Journals require subscription, are pay walled.<p>By other side, the reviewers of such papers, academics and researchers from other universities, don&#x27;t receive economical compensation for doing the review, while the taken APCs fee its supposed for doing it? only in few cases the review is compensated by some programs of the reviewer&#x27;s university or other 3rd parties. Then, what is for all those pay-walls and publish-fees?<p>Sounds like a big filter... for what? for who? Because can be seen it&#x27;s not working just as a mere &quot;quality&quot; filter.<p>So as an outsider point of view (from time to time I have to use Sci-Hub in fact), I understand if they decide to don&#x27;t publish in such popular Journals, and I consider absolutely legitimate if researchers consider publish in mere distribution sites like arXiv. Or even better if its done also in parallel through one of those open research platforms with tools for peer review.<p>But, what I would really would like to be able to access is an open research platform without any kind of pay walled paper, like arXiv, push a bottom where to read the paper&#x27;s peer reviews done through such platform, across the time, and also have access to debates about such paper like if it were hacker news, Why to send email to the autor existing forums technology?</div><br/></div></div><div id="36916759" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36916759" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xorbax</span><span>|</span><a href="#36916455">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36916618">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36918267">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36916918">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36916759">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36916759">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The thing that established journals do better than arXiv is clarity<p>You can upload whatever trash methods you want, but a normal journal will have at least one guy who tells you to wipe your ass and make your bullshit presentable in public, if only because they&#x27;re expected to be gatekeepers for a minimum standard of supposed reproducibility.</div><br/><div id="36917126" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36917126" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">godelski</span><span>|</span><a href="#36916455">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36916759">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36917749">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36917126">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36917126">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In practice I&#x27;m not seeing much of a difference.

Peer review is peers looking and reviewing. More peer review happens on Twitter than these conferences.

AFAIU there&#x27;s a substantial amount of high quality research in, e.g., Japan that is invisible to non-Japanese speakers. Japan&#x27;s scientific establishment long predates English as a global language, unlike China; and unlike many European countries but similar to the United States there was never a widespread norm of learning foreign languages even among the professional classes, AFAIU. Though Korea is a younger industrialized country, I wouldn&#x27;t take for granted that the principal discoverers have any English proficiency, especially considering that they would be late middle-age or older if they were working in the lab in 1999.</div><br/><div id="36917113" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36917113" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xorbax</span><span>|</span><a href="#36916455">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36916906">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36917049">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36917113">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36917113">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I dunno, I&#x27;d be suspect of the argument was that the directions were perfect in Korean and merely totally hidden from industrious Americans.<p>Japanese and Korean professionals speak English.

People who don&#x27;t speak English <i>well</i> <i>enough</i> are not generally going to participate in events or situations where they would need to rely on English-language speaking skills. That someone apologies for their bad English is, of course, irrelevant; if it were truly bad you wouldn&#x27;t have encountered them. Likewise, Japan has many international science programs, forums, and conferences; and they&#x27;ll be filled with proficient Japanese English speakers, but Japan is a huge nation so it says little necessarily about broader patterns.<p>I don&#x27;t doubt that a majority of professional research scientists in Japan have some proficiency in English. Especially the top scientists; even in Japan &quot;impact&quot; would undoubtedly be heavily biased toward publication in prestigious international journals. But there&#x27;s plenty of literature on the internet that describes the <i>relatively</i> poor English-language proficiency (especially conversationally or with verbiage outside that in their technical field) and poor English-speaking research community integration of the broader Japanese scientific establishment. See, e.g., &quot;Japanese materials scientists&#x27; experiences with English for research publication purposes&quot;.<p>I first encountered this cultural dynamic when researching the tilting of the Millennium Tower. While friction piles weren&#x27;t first used in Japan, Japan was where friction piles were first heavily researched and employed for large buildings, including skyscrapers. People kept saying friction piles were idiotic in earthquake-prone, sandy soils, but that&#x27;s precisely the environment where they were first researched and from whence the global engineering community&#x27;s confidence sprouted. However, AFAICT much of that research was published in Japanese, even through the late 20th century and (IIRC) even early 21st century. Was that Nobel-worthy science? No, but it was very useful applied science; and applied science which was highly consequential to global engineering and architecture, notwithstanding that much of the substance of it existed on the other side of a Japanese language barrier.<p>[1] See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC8024886&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC8024886&#x2F;</a><p>[2] But see, e.g., China and Brazil where domestic publication dominates and even outpacing international publication: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.digital-science.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;japan-collaboration-in-the-global-research-landscape&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.digital-science.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;japan-collabora...</a><p>[3] E.g. many of the publications by the The Japan Institute of Metals and Materials are only or predominately in Japanese.

I once went to a packed talk at Stanford where some physicists and chemists were trying to reproduce the effect. They mentioned that in the first attempts, they had radiation alarms set up in case the thing suddenly started emitting substantial amounts of radiation. After a while, it became clear that the effect, if it existed at all, was small, somewhere below twice background radiation, so it wasn&#x27;t high risk. 
They discovered that people moving around the apparatus affected the results; humans have a lot of water and are neutron reflectors. 
Finally they did the experiment inside a &quot;neutron cube&quot;, a box made of lead bricks, to eliminate stray neutrons. No neutron generation measured inside the cube.<p>They worked hard for months getting to a definitive &quot;no&quot;.</div><br/><div id="36917363" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36917363" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xorbax</span><span>|</span><a href="#36916562">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36917261">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36916856">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36917363">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36917363">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Right.
