In a practical sense, it&#x27;s become much worse and we have many more layers now. In a foundational sense, we succeeded in giving up because we learned that we can in some sense pick and choose whatever is most convenient for our line of research.<p>That&#x27;s probably okay if we view mathematics in the way this book (I have not read it, going based on the description here) advocates, as a sort of toy for playing with arguments. And I&#x27;m certainly not saying Math should ever be viewed as an empirical discipline nor constrained by that kind of thinking. But I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m the only one that takes one look at things in the realm of say higher category theory and thinks it&#x27;s mostly playing word and symbol manipulation games, and lacks any real mathematical content that could not be discovered at a lower and more understandable (and less likely to produce new research) level of abstraction.<p>I guess I&#x27;ve sort of betrayed that I am pretty firmly a platonist in that respect so make of that what you will.<p>Like I said, this is not an unusual opinion for a computer person to have and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fairly annoying to any pure mathematician at this point. But I think it&#x27;s still fair if we want to understand what turns certain people off of pursuing mathematics further.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37655087" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37655087" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">leetcodesucks</span><span>|</span><a href="#37655051">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37655905">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37655942">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37655087">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37655087">[10 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Its still not stiff enough.

Some love the math and have little difficulty determining the correct answer to a problem while others loathe and dislike the math and have a difficult time ascertaining the correct response.  Many times, a student is humbled or chastised for asking ‘a stupid question’.  Author Cheng states that there are no stupid questions.

For example, on p.42 there is a helpful definition of “cisgender”, in case you didn’t know. Then, on p.319, the notion of isomorphism — ubiquitous in mathematics, and really quite simple — is explained by considering two categories induced by a partial ordering, one consisting of concepts involving rich, white and male, and another involving rich, white and cisgender. It is then shown that rich white cisgender women have the same status in the second category as rich white males do in the first. Just below this, there is a helpful diagram showing that each of these categories is a 3-fold product of the category consisting of two objects and one arrow, namely (people with structural power —&gt; people who are structurally oppressed).

I feel similarly about certain fields of science; the ideas are really very simple but whenever you hear someone explaining them, the explanation seems to be full of gaps, rely on the audience to make certain assumptions, use custom terminology or terminology repurposed from different fields which can create confusion.<p>I often felt that being good at math requires having a natural talent for making the right assumptions to fill in any gaps or ambiguity in explanations.

Math is an epistemological tool to abstract the causality of existence into a simplified structure amenable to consideration and manipulation by human consciousness.<p>A quadratic equation can be used to approximate the coordinates of the trajectory of a thrown object in a gravity field. I think the really interesting question is why that particular equation reflects that trajectory.

And for these models, there is (in the meta-theory) a bijection between the set representing the set of real numbers, and the set (in the meta theory) of natural numbers.<p>I don’t think this establishes that “in fact” there is a bijection between the real numbers and the natural numbers.<p>Rather, in any model of any of the usual set theories, there will be no bijection between the set of real numbers and the set of natural numbers. (Of course there will not be, because these theories entail that there is no such bijection.)<p>If I take a non-standard model of arithmetic, and for some non-standard natural number n, and consider the uniform distribution of (non-standard) natural numbers  less than n, then for every standard natural number, the probability of getting that natural number from that distribution, will be equal.

I have yet to publish it, but it&#x27;ll probably turn up somewhere else towards the end of the year:<p>Preliminaries:   (1) Let T be a first-order theory with a countable or uncountable infinite model M.  (2) Let L be the language of T.  (3) T is assumed to be a set of sentences (closed formulas) in L.
Algorithm Steps:<p>Initialize Countable Set S:  Start with S = Const(L), the set of all constant symbols in L.<p>Extend Language: For each n-ary relation R in L and each n-tuple (c1, ..., cn) of elements in S, if M⊨R(c1, ..., cn), then add a new constant symbol c to S and extend L to L&#x27; by adding c.<p>Iterate for All Formulas: For each formula ϕ(x1, ..., xn) in L and each n-tuple (c1, ..., cn) of elements in S: If M⊨∃xϕ(c1, ..., cn), then pick some a in M such that M⊨ϕ(a, c1, ..., cn).  Add a new constant symbol c to S to represent a and extend L to L&#x27; by adding c.<p>Closure: Repeat Steps 2 and 3 until S no longer changes. Since T and L are countable, this process will eventually result in a countable set S.
Construct Countable Model N: Take the substructure of M generated by S as N. By construction, N is countable.<p>Elementary Submodel Check: By construction, N is an elementary submodel of M. This is because for any formula ϕ and any n-tuple (c1, ..., cn) from S, M⊨ϕ(c1, ..., cn) if and only if N⊨ϕ(c1, ..., cn).<p>Conclusion: N is a countable elementary submodel of M, and therefore T has a countable model.  End.<p>You&#x27;re right about the bijection, but, in the countable model, the set that &quot;represents&quot; the real numbers is countable. (From the perspective of the meta-theory.) However, within the model itself, this set still satisfies all the axioms that make it &quot;look&quot; uncountable. For example, there&#x27;s no bijection between this set and the set representing the natural numbers within the model, even though such a bijection exists in the meta-theory.<p>This is why Skolem&#x27;s solution can be most succinctly described: &quot;Every set has a countable model if one steps outside the set and constructs a countable model from its elements.&quot;<p>In Kleene&#x27;s “Introduction to Metamathematics,” he describes the situation as follows:  &quot;Either we must maintain that the concepts of an arbitrary subset of a given set, and of a non-enumerable set, are a priori concepts which elude characterization by any finite or enumerably infinite system of elementary axioms; or else (if we stick to what can be explicitly characterized by elementary axioms, as we may well wish to in consequence of the set-theoretic paradoxes ) we must accept the set-theoretic concepts, in particular that of non-enumerability, as being relative, so that a set which is non-enumerable in a given axiomatization n may become enumerable in another, and no absolute non-enumerability exists.&quot;</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="37652539" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37652539" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">contravariant</span><span>|</span><a href="#37651806">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37652069">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37652719">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37652303">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37652539">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37652539">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">To be fair it&#x27;s not <i>too</i> strange to consider both the natural numbers and the power sets to be to greater or lesser extents abstractions to allow us to reason about all the things we can logically put in one of them.<p>After all both of them are mostly full of things we will never need, encounter, or even be able to define.</div><br/><div id="37652820" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37652820" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bawolff</span><span>|</span><a href="#37651806">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37652539">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37652303">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37652820">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37652820">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I kind of think the core of the question of if math is real, is if abstractions are &quot;real&quot;.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="37652303" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37652303" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dicriseg</span><span>|</span><a href="#37651806">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37652069">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37654232">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37652303">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37652303">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I was going to post something similar and then saw yours, and it was better.
