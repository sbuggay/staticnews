There&#x27;s so much history from events in the early 2000s that has been lost. So many links in ancient web forums that 404 and aren&#x27;t in the Internet archive. Info from the 2010s is much better but still missing a lot of media. As an individual, I certainly don&#x27;t have the resources of some of the organizations listed in this article but I&#x27;ve been trying to do what I can and mirror important sites. I dread seeing what the future looks like as more and more of the communities in my niche move onto discord and away from more traditional web forums.<p>ETA: The issue I face is two-fold. More pressingly, there are files just missing. Nothing I can do about that barring someone magically having them downloaded to an old PC. But also interesting is working with old formats. The 2000s&#x2F;early 2010s Halloween Horror Nights websites were all written in Flash. They have tons of little Easter eggs and information for the event obsessives like me. Between fan backups and the Internet archive, the files are pretty complete thankfully. But since Flash has been dead for a while, I have to rely on the Ruffles Flash emulator to get it running on the web. But that doesn&#x27;t work super well. On my list of things to do is to contribute to the project to try to get some of the files working.<p>In case anyone is curious about my backup of the event or if you&#x27;re also a fan and have any of the files listed to share and archive, my site is hhncrypt.com!</div><br/><div id="37355335" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37355335" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">usea</span><span>|</span><a href="#37354833">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37356020">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37355335">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37355335">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Just yesterday I went searching for a memorial page for someone who died in 2005.

It will likely frustrate the next few generations of genealogists hunting for records of early 21st century ancestors.<p>Obituaries that appeared in print newspapers during the 20th century were easily disseminated and decentrally archived (typically by loved ones and libraries), making them relatively rot-tolerant.<p>Distribution isn’t a problem for digital obituaries, and in many ways the web is better than print in this respect.<p>But when it comes to preservation, there are many factors that make digital obits in their current state particularly susceptible to rot.  They tend to be centrally archived and often behind paywalls, making them susceptible to digital rot and difficult for organizations acting in the public interest to archive.<p>The for-profit company Legacy.com controls a strikingly large share of the market for digital obituaries. It partners with funeral homes and newspapers, and in many cases when a visitor browses obituaries on the website of a local newspaper or funeral home, they’re actually redirected to Legacy.com, which hosts the content.<p>Unfortunately, the newspapers and funeral homes themselves often don’t maintain their own copies of the obituaries.  What happens if Legacy.com or one of the smaller memorial sites goes out of business or experiences some sort of data loss? Because of the centralized nature of how these digital obituaries are stored, it’s possible that very few other organizations will have archived copies of the content.</div><br/><div id="37356238" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37356238" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">numtel</span><span>|</span><a href="#37355290">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37355010">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37356238">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37356238">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For these kinds of things that don&#x27;t take a ton of data, a blockchain is a great place to store them for a long time for one upfront fee.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37355010" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37355010" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rrherr</span><span>|</span><a href="#37355290">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37355326">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37355010">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37355010">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20230901181858&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;longnow.org&#x2F;ideas&#x2F;shining-a-light-on-the-digital-dark-age&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20230901181858&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;longnow.o...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="37355326" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37355326" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">grglburgp</span><span>|</span><a href="#37355010">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37355375">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37355326">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37355326">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Attenuation of signal is how reality works.<p>Generational churn means eventually no one who knows why the nested dolls were nested as they are will be gone.
