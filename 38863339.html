He really was the first to get serious about formalizing concurrency. P and V, and all that.<p>This feels very retro. I used to work on this sort of thing, but that was back in the early 1980s. This reads like something from back then, when people were first figuring out how to think about concurrency.[1] That&#x27;s how people thought about this back then.<p>There&#x27;s been progress in the last four decades. There are completely different approaches, such as symbolic execution. The Microsoft Static Driver Verifier is an example. There&#x27;s also a theory of eventually-consistent systems now, with conflict-free replicated data types. It&#x27;s also more common today to think about concurrency in terms of messages rather than variable access, which is easier to reason about. There&#x27;s also more of a handle on the tooling problem. Not enough of a handle, though. Proof of correctness software still hasn&#x27;t really gone mainstream. (In IC design, though...)<p>There&#x27;s a tendency in this area to fall in love with the notation and formalism, rather than viewing it as a means for making better software. In practice, most of the things you need to prove in program proving are trivial, and have to be mechanized or you never get anything done. Once in a while, a theoretically difficult problem shows up. You need some way to address those abstractly and feed the results back into the semi-automated system.<p>The main concurrent problem addressed in this paper is the Paxos algorithm. That&#x27;s similar to the earlier arbiter problem.[2] The arbiter problem is also about resolving who wins access to a shared resource in a parallel system. It&#x27;s down at the hardware level, where two processors talk to one memory, and has to be resolved in nanoseconds or less. There&#x27;s no sound way to select a winner in one round. But, for each round, you can tell if the algorithm has settled and produced a winner. You have to iterate until it settles. There&#x27;s no upper bound on how many rounds it takes, but it is statistically unlikely for it to take very many. Arbiters were the first hardware device to have that property, and it was very upsetting at the time. Multiprocessor computers were built before the arbiter problem was solved, and they did indeed have hardware race conditions on access to memory. I used to debug operating systems for those things, and we did get crashes from that.<p>Good to see someone is still plugging away on the classics.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;manualzilla-id-5928072&#x2F;mode&#x2F;2up" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;manualzilla-id-5928072&#x2F;mode&#x2F;2up</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Arbiter_%28electronics%29" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Arbiter_%28electronics%29</a></div><br/><div id="38864717" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38864717" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tkhattra</span><span>|</span><a href="#38864518">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38863847">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38864717">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38864717">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; He really was the first to get serious about formalizing concurrency.

Scientists are computer scientists who are interested in concurrent computing. If you are a scientist, you should be well-prepared to decide if this book interests you and to read it if it does.<p>&quot;Engineers are people involved in building concurrent programs. If you are an engineer, you might have a job title such as programmer, software engineer, or hardware designer. I need to warn you that this book is about a science, not about its practical application. Practice is discussed only to explain the motivation for the science. If you are interested just in using the science, you should read about the language TLA+ and its tools, which are the practical embodiment of the science [27, 34]. But if you want to understand the underlying science, then this book may be for you.&quot;</div><br/><div id="38864024" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38864024" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">maweki</span><span>|</span><a href="#38863847">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38864617">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38864024">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38864024">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There&#x27;s a line between the discovered stuff and the invented stuff.
