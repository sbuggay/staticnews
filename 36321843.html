I personally suffer from IBS, migraines, sleeping problems, and mood swings, if I haven&#x27;t taken a dose of psychedelics in the last 6 months. Now, getting regular exercise, eating well, staying hydrated, sleeping 8 hours a night, spending time with friends, sexual and emotional fulfillment, and performing fulfilling labor, that will get you 80% or even 100% towards fixing <i>most</i>, if not all your problems. But I think these Serotonergic drugs give people the extra push in the right direction, and immediately fixes a lot of the underlying problems that would normally take consistent, positive environmental changes to root out.<p>I myself am biased towards psychedelics, but I understand they&#x27;re not for everyone. But SSRIs tend to be overprescribed and because they are often taken for far longer than necessary they cause a lot of changes neurophysically that aren&#x27;t necessarily positive (and the most common side-effect, the loss of sex-drive, often creates many more problems for the user in their personal life.)
