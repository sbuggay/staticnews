I&#x27;ve had this domain for over 20 years already, so I don&#x27;t mind 5 years extra, because I know I&#x27;m keeping it. Basically, everything the article said.<p>The domains for my company are all registered for 3 years up-front, and I try to renew them annually to keep at least 2 years before expiry, but I also know that if I died, someone else would either take over or wind up the company, and in either case they can deal with the domains as part of that, and if they have a long grace period, that&#x27;s fine.<p>And in terms of the privacy concerns of the article, I have several separate domains that I use when dealing with companies. For a long time, I used addresses based on my main domain name with the company name before the @, but I&#x27;d already blocked a load of addresses where the company sold their client list (even some quite random companies like recruitment agencies seem to get tempted by this) and decided to just move to a couple of domains solely for this purpose. They have no obvious relationship to my name, so they&#x27;re perfect if the e-mail address was later sold on.<p>To be honest, the biggest issue with dying isn&#x27;t the registration of my domain names, it&#x27;s that nobody else would even know <i>HOW</i> to get my e-mail from my private server. Currently, that&#x27;s less of a problem than it might be as I use gmail as a client, so it fetches using POP from the various accounts on my servers, but if I died and nobody could access my gmail, it&#x27;d be a bit harder.<p>That said, in the UK after you die, the executor of your will has legal authority to contact any company you had dealings with before and take over your account or affairs. So honestly, as long as I document my bank account numbers, and make my property deeds and will easily discoverable, I&#x27;m not really too bothered about anything else.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37478038" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37478038" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bad_user</span><span>|</span><a href="#37477619">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37477771">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37478038">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37478038">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Fastmail supports &quot;masked email&quot;, a feature for generating random email addresses.

But now they&#x27;ve announced that they are. Also, Yahoo. Gmail is well behaved, but it&#x27;s incredibly frustrating to create a new Gmail username.

Using a unique domain name for email stands out,<p>True, but you can use a masked email with your own domain too, several services provide that, masked email -&gt; your domain email, so you can have iCloud masked email sent to your domain one.<p>Having your own domain as an email provides a lot of advantages, The top one is you are provider agnostic, if you don’t like X provider, just change your MX, SPF, etc. DNS and you are good to go in a few minutes, now imagine if that would be something@gmail and you wanted to change to another@gmail, You have to go to all the services you are using and signed up for (assuming you have a list of them say in a password vault), change each, verify each, and then update your password vault so the new email is used, good luck with a whole week work.<p>Another big advantage of using your own domain is the concept of separation of concerns, If that site is breached, not only you will know faster than the site admin, but that email is only valid for that account, and useless elsewhere. Additionally, anyone who is using OSINT against you, will not be able to pull out all the services you are using&#x2F;used with that email, that also works if you have masked emails.<p>Just keep in mind, if you use your own domain try as much as possible to have a .com one, I noticed some providers (MS Exchange&#x2F;Outlook) mark some domains that are not .com as spam.<p>Lastly, emails are NOT secure, the protocol was not designed with security in mind, no matter if the provider is promising top notch security, it is not, the only time it is secure if PGP is used by both parties.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37477997" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37477997" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">extr</span><span>|</span><a href="#37478173">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37477908">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37477997">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37477997">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve gone back and forth on this.

A gmail.com address does not stand out as much, but it is much less private than a self-hosted account on a domain and servers that I own and control.<p>In my view, privacy is not about being inrecognizable, it&#x27;s about having control over what aspects of my identity are revealed to the public. A custom domain (unless you&#x27;re using your last name or something similar) reveals very little about you except maybe your pseudonym and the fact you probably run your own email.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for anonymity, email is a very bad place to start.
That being said, I still use my gmail occasionally, mainly for things that need 100% uptime and can&#x27;t ever get filtered by the recipient&#x27;s spam filter. My doctor&#x27;s appointments, electronic ID, for example, still have my Gmail set as a backup address, mainly to prevent me losing basic services in case of some catastrophic failure of my servers.<p>Overall, running email yourself is fairly complicated, and probably one of the last things you ever want to do self-hosting-wise.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37478049" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37478049" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">imadj</span><span>|</span><a href="#37477908">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37477950">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37478049">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37478049">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; most websites using it as a way to reset your password<p>&gt; Privacy...
