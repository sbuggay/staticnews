I do agree with many points, documentation IS amazing, and you are very likely under-documenting things in your company. But documentation is not cheap to create, and specially it&#x27;s not cheap to maintain. If you are not writing enough yes, sure, that&#x27;s probably a great investment, but start bit by bit.<p>I&#x27;ve worked in <i>multiple* companies where the problem was too much documentation, and of course everyone was afraid to update or </i>ghasps* remove any piece of old documentation in case it was still useful. Imagine working on a codebase where 80% of the code was unused or commented out but no one dared changing it just in case (flashback to 2010 with 4000 lines of style.css).<p>I&#x27;d suggest to take a more holistic approach and treat documentation a lot like testing; for that prototype, probably just write the barebones documentation, for the production-ready new feature go all-in and write detailed documentation, tutorials, etc.<p>If you do want to go deeper with documentation, then you&#x27;ll need a dedicated team (like a team of testers) that work exclusively on documentation. At some point it does make sense to hire only for that, and it can even be a differentiating point for your startup if done correctly.<p>For libraries, a ratio I&#x27;ve seen works pretty well is approx 1:3:5 for lines of code:tests:docs; you can do tests first, or even documentation first, but once everything is finished and if you count the amount of lines that&#x27;s a decent ratio. Note that when counting &quot;lines of docs&quot; in an editor, a whole paragraph will count as just 1, so in reality there&#x27;s a lot more docs.<p>Note: I&#x27;m the creator of both <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;documentation.page&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;documentation.page&#x2F;</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;documentation.agency&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;documentation.agency&#x2F;</a><p>* (only 2 &quot;negative&quot; paragraphs on a book-length article)</div><br/><div id="36289929" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36289929" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">atoav</span><span>|</span><a href="#36288740">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36290064">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36289929">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36289929">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I really like the way documentation works in Rust: You basically write markdown in a special type of comment over the module, function, datatype or method you wanna document and then you can convert that into documentation automatically.<p>Even better: if you have examples in code blocks in these docstrings per default they get tested as well, so if you don&#x27;t update them, the tests will fail and you will notice.<p>In my eyes one of <i>the</i> biggest problems with keeping documentation up to date is that over time the mapping between the piece of code you are documenting and the place where you find it in the documentation becomes more complex, to a point where missing something is not unlikely.

This leads to hightly enlightening prose documentation that the get_height method &quot;gets the height&quot;, and that its return value is the height. A more high level problem with this is that you get documentation that is just as fragmented as the code and where the high level usage of things is not explained at all.

I&#x27;d love too much documentation.<p>But I understand your point. The only thing worse than no documentation is <i>wrong</i> documentation, and outdated docs half the time can become outright wrong half the time, if it isn&#x27;t simply encouraging outdated but functional practices. Tech writers are highly undervalued for that purpose.<p>I should also mention that the ability to properly search for docs is almost more important than the doc itself. Some companies had wikis but good luck searching for the right keywords if you didn&#x27;t know the exact title.

That takes time and effort to write, and it takes time and effort to keep it updated as things change. As the author notes, it will have to be something that is made part of the culture of the organization. And given that recent agile programming approaches proclaim that &quot;the code is the documentation&quot; and that formal, separate documentation is an impediment to productivity, you&#x27;ll find that many developers will dig in their heels if asked to write documentation.<p>Bad, outdated, or just plain wrong documentation can be worse than nothing, as it tends to lead you to incorrect conclusions and beliefs about the system.</div><br/><div id="36288894" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36288894" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">makeitdouble</span><span>|</span><a href="#36288356">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36288602">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36288894">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36288894">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; OpenBSD&#x27;s man pages are one example.<p>OpenBDS&#x27;s developer to user ratio must be less that 1 to 1000s.

At some level of seniority (the more junior the better IMO) we expect developers to write design docs. The inability to communicate clearly in those documents is a huge problem. Oftentimes misunderstandings and ambiguities are cleared up at design review, but then never reintegrated into the document, leaving two artifacts, the implementation and the design doc. These obviously drift over time, maintaining correspondence is hard. But when one only ambiguously described the other from the get go, then the documentation is broken. This too is technical debt.<p>If you are fortunate, you can write code in an organization which has a high code quality bar, uses consistent styles etc.  But it is rare (vanishingly so I nearly 30 years experience) to find the same bar applied to the design docs.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36289331" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36289331" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">abraae</span><span>|</span><a href="#36288356">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36288602">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36289506">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36288810">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36289331">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36289331">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Certainly writing is a skill that many programmers are not good at.<p>However IMO an easy trap to fall into is to start documenting without a bigger understanding of the audience and the purpose of the doc.<p>A good way to start is to identify which of the 4 types of documentation you are working on.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nick.groenen.me&#x2F;posts&#x2F;the-4-types-of-technical-documentation&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nick.groenen.me&#x2F;posts&#x2F;the-4-types-of-technical-docum...</a><p>Personally I find it very easy to put too much explanation in the wrong places.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36288810" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36288810" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eviks</span><span>|</span><a href="#36288356">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36288602">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36289488">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36288810">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36288810">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">another key word is &quot;searchable&quot; documentation, and that&#x27;s where man pages fail big time leading you to the likes of Google</div><br/><div id="36288973" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36288973" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sarnowski</span><span>|</span><a href="#36288356">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36288810">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36289488">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36288973">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36288973">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What degree of „searchable“ are you missing from apropos?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;man.openbsd.org&#x2F;apropos.1" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;man.openbsd.org&#x2F;apropos.1</a></div><br/><div id="36289850" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36289850" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eviks</span><span>|</span><a href="#36288356">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36288973">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36289488">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36289850">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36289850">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">All of the basics of anything google-like: typo-friendliness with word forms and phrases, links to source, formatting of output, GUI, or not spamming the output with a dozen of lines of warnings that some man page files are missing.<p>Then a bunch more degrees that I could know about if the tool were more usable</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36289488" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36289488" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">63</span><span>|</span><a href="#36288356">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36289988">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36289488">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36289488">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ll add that what a lot of non-developers seem to think is documentation is not actually worth very much.

But those tickets are just floating in the ether and are not formally attached to any specific component, let alone route.<p>I was hoping AI would help but I can&#x27;t seem to find anything relevant.<p>What would you do?</div><br/><div id="36289144" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36289144" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">onion2k</span><span>|</span><a href="#36288910">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36289209">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36289144">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36289144">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>What would you do?</i><p>Accept that it&#x27;s a big job and just get on with it.

And yes, good documentation takes a lot of investment but it pays off like compound interest. But with that done, it becomes even more important not to pull the carpet for no good reason, you are building a tower and documentation is at the foundation.<p>We’ve built Lowdefy [1] as an open source project and documented it with all effort, 200 pages of docs. I often forget why or how something works and then jump to the docs. This investment keeps on paying of as we use Lowdefy to build customer apps, new devs in the team typically take less than two week to get up to speed and start making contributions, the sharp ones, just a two or three days.<p>This year, we’re extended our documentation onto customer apps aswell, with flow diagrams, state machine definitions, detailed field level explication schema definitions, and end user test procedures. The key here for this documentation is detail.
