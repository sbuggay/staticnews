I still occasionally reminisce about that time in primary school, when one of the classmates bought (well, his parents did, I suppose) an original, boxed copy of StarCraft. He used to briefly lend the CD, and at some point copies of the CD started circulating, and he would just share the CD key with a few people - but in between, he lent me the <i>manual</i>.<p>I think I was the only one who really cared about it. I&#x27;ve had it for months, I think. Read it cover to cover more times than I could count. Pretty much memorized every bit of lore and trivia there was in it - and there was quite a lot. The manual itself was a small booklet, with a couple pages of backstory for each of the playable species, plus a lot of extra world-building details about individual units, buildings and planets. So even as I didn&#x27;t have access to the game, my own imagination built a whole world and infinite stories out of what some would consider &quot;filler content&quot;. But this filler content made me care, and eventually shell out my pocket money for Brood War, and later on, money from my first full-time job on the collector&#x27;s edition of StarCraft II.<p>That SC manual came probably at the tail end of the era where the publishers put any kind of effort into manuals. Case in point: SC:BW came with just a tiny booklet with about equal split between lore&#x2F;context, instructions for the new and changed game aspects, and legal&#x2F;credits. SC II came... well, I don&#x27;t know with, by that time Blizzard stopped caring about the game story anyway.<p>(Oh, and speaking of warm memories of computer manuals in the 90s, I have a special place in my heart for the big, heavy, couple hundred pages long manual to Word 6.0 (not 100% sure about the exact version), and earlier, for the interactive self-training application that came included with Windows 3.11 - that one taught me how to use the mouse!)</div><br/><div id="36580757" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36580757" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sbierwagen</span><span>|</span><a href="#36577267">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36580640">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36581690">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36580757">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36580757">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I fondly remember the manuals for Homeworld 1 and Homeworld Cataclysm.

I went all the way back to the first one. It was pretty easy to triangulate some of them. Some of them have clues to location in the photos. It was fun.<p>I would like to point out some issues with the scale displayed. There are quite a few cases where the scale only changes when you shift the map so your guess could be affected by an incorrect scale. The first location was one example. After I guessed the location from the first photo (it&#x27;s pretty obvious if you have been out there) I made a second guess that cut the error by about half. My third guess was inside the radius which appeared to be about 5 miles even though  the actual location plotted as correct was well outside any point that could&#x27;ve been triangulated from the first two guesses. I suspect the scale was not correct since moving the map by grabbing it updated the scale.<p>I managed to get quite a few of the 75 or so available by the third guess. I got a couple on the second guess since I recognized the geology of the area. All in all when you miss by 0.02 miles I think it is close enough. This makes me think the error radius changes based on the individual photo since I had narrowed the location to within 0.04 miles on one California location and wasted two picks narrowing the location while still remaining outside the &quot;correct&quot; radius.<p>Pretty fun stuff. Thank you sir.
