The information they gather is circumstantial and probably would not hold up in court, but they can use it as grounds to get a warrant.<p>Let&#x27;s imagine a different case. Instead of police having to go in and ask nicely for customer logs and security footage, the owner happens to have meticulous notes that he keeps and sells to randos around town. Creepy... but it&#x27;s largely the same data that they could have gotten by asking nicely enough anyway.<p>If there is no law against the proprietor bundling up his customer data and selling it, it doesn&#x27;t seem like there is a strong legal case against police using it.<p>Obviously, this is a MUCH bigger problem on the internet than in real life - just in the huge difference in scale in the amount of data and the ability to parse it.</div><br/><div id="39138962" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39138962" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mu53</span><span>|</span><a href="#39137726">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39139334">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39138962">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39138962">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think this gets down to a fundamental problem with tech that society is ignoring like a pink elephant in the room.<p>Society fundamentally changed with the introduction of computers.

Firecrackers are sold without license, small amount of gunpowder. Dynamite and other explosives with larger amounts of gunpowder are heavily restricted because of the damage that can be done. Today, there are laws against re-packaging explosives to protect people.<p>I believe the damage that these datasets are doing to society are covert and second-order effects that are hard to track. Most datasets like what the NSA are doing are kept secret precisely because they don&#x27;t want transparency.
