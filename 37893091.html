[...]<p>&quot;It may well make no logical sense, as many have pointed out, to be more upset at the felling of one picturesque tree than at the destruction of whole rainforests. Yet, that is how humans are, for better or worse: we connect emotionally with individuals. The capacity of trees to embody a sort of individuality — to be anthropomorphised, if you like — may go some way towards explaining why our ancestors held them sacred.

The shredded leaves make a really great mulching layer just before winter, when grasses and other plants need that extra insulation, and then they break down and nourish the soil in spring when everything starts actively growing again.<p>Do this process year after year, and you will have an absolutely gorgeous garden before long. It&#x27;s a really good reason to plant deciduous trees (especially those that shed a lot of leaves that are too heavy to blow away). But they take such a long time to grow; you are super lucky to have a mature one over your garden already!</div><br/></div></div><div id="37894638" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37894638" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kdmccormick</span><span>|</span><a href="#37894573">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37895409">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37894621">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37894638">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37894638">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Okay, rake them up then?</div><br/></div></div><div id="37894621" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37894621" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mvdtnz</span><span>|</span><a href="#37894573">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37894638">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37893644">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37894621">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37894621">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Oh no I&#x27;m so sorry you have to deal with nature.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37893644" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37893644" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">doctorpangloss</span><span>|</span><a href="#37894573">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37893414">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37893644">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37893644">[13 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In my community: I love the cutsie pootsie Victorians everywhere, the time-capsule 1910s look.

It doesn&#x27;t make evolutionary sense for feelings to not have bounds. So, there are bounds - feelings usually intensify with close proximity, and there is a bunch of mechanisms that quell feelings and empathy, like dissociation. What you&#x27;re seeing is just these mechanisms in work. The very concept of fairness, and so unfairness, also only exists in humans.
