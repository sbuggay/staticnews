His discussion of self-driving is more analogous to robots building cars in a Tesla factory displacing workers than anything AGI.  We&#x27;ve already had &quot;self driving&quot; trains where we got rid of the human train driver.  Nothing &quot;AGI&quot; about that.  The evolution of getting cars to self drive not necessarily making the entity controlling the car more human-like intelligent.  It&#x27;s more like meeting in between the human driver and the factory robot +&#x2F;- some technology.<p>So how to define AGI?  I&#x27;m not sure economic value factors here.  I would lean towards a definition around problem solving.  When computers can solve general problems as well as humans, that&#x27;s AGI.  You want to find a drug for cancer, or drive a car, or prove a math theorem, or write a computer program to accomplish something, or whatever problems humans solve all the time.  (EDIT: or reason about what problems need to be solved as part of addressing other problems.) There&#x27;s already classes of problems, like chess, where computers outperform humans.  But I mean calculators did that for arithmetic a long time ago. The &quot;G&quot; part is whether or not we have a generalized computer that excels at everything.</div><br/><div id="39087642" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39087642" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jillesvangurp</span><span>|</span><a href="#39086282">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39087114">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39087642">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39087642">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s a meaningless distinction. You basically get sucked into a &quot;what has AI ever done for us?&quot; style debate analogous to Monty Python&#x27;s Life of Brian. It&#x27;s impossible to resolve. But the irony of course is the huge and growing list of things it is actually doing quite nicely.<p>We&#x27;ll have decently smart AIs before we nail down what that G actually means, should mean, absolutely cannot mean, etc. Which is usually what these threads on HN devolve into. Andrej Karpathy is basically side stepping that debate and using self driving as a case study for two simple reasons: 1) we&#x27;re already doing it (which is getting hard to deny or nitpick about) and 2) it requires a certain level of understanding of things around us that goes beyond traditional automation.<p>You are dismissing self driving as mere &quot;automation&quot;. But that of course applies to just about everything we do with computers. Driving is sufficiently hard that it seems to require the best minds many years to get there and we&#x27;re basically getting people like Andreij Karpathy and his colleagues from Google, Waymo, Microsoft, Tesla, etc. bootstrapping a whole new field of AI as a side effect. The whole reason we&#x27;re even talking about AGI is those people. The things you list, most people cannot do either. Well over 99% of the people I meet are completely useless for any of those things. But I wouldn&#x27;t call them stupid for that reason.<p>Some people even go as far to say that we won&#x27;t nail self driving without an AGI. But then since we already have some self driving cars that are definitely not that intelligent yet, they are probably wrong. For varying definitions of the G in AGI.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39087114" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39087114" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">riffraff</span><span>|</span><a href="#39086282">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39087642">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39086827">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39087114">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39087114">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yeah, it seems as if he has forgotten the G.<p>I recall Norvig&#x27;s AI book preaching decades ago that &quot;intelligent&quot; does not mean able to do everything, and that for an agent to be useful it was enough to solve a small problem.<p>Which in my mind is where the G came from.<p>And yet we now suddenly go back to the old narrow definition?<p>I still see no path from LLMs and autonomous driving to AGI.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39086827" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39086827" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">a-dub</span><span>|</span><a href="#39086282">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39086441">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39086827">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39086827">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;AGI: An autonomous system that surpasses human capabilities in the majority of economically valuable work.&quot; -- what an obscenely depressing reduction of a fascinating field of inquiry. who the hell snuck in and redefined the science of thinking machines to this sad and reductive get rich quick crap?</div><br/><div id="39086979" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39086979" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nl</span><span>|</span><a href="#39086827">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39086958">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39086979">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39086979">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; who the hell snuck in and redefined the science of thinking machines to this sad and reductive get rich quick crap?<p>OpenAI, back in 2018: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openai.com&#x2F;charter" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openai.com&#x2F;charter</a><p>It wasn&#x27;t particularly controversial at the time - didn&#x27;t get mentioned in the HN discussion: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=16794194">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=16794194</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="39086958" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39086958" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ActorNightly</span><span>|</span><a href="#39086827">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39086979">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39087211">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39086958">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39086958">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Its not really about &quot;get rich&quot;, its about giving people the ability to bypass the middleman for pretty much anything that they rely on.</div><br/><div id="39087213" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39087213" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Radim</span><span>|</span><a href="#39086827">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39086958">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39087211">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39087213">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39087213">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The &quot;middleman&quot; being other people, i.e. themselves from another&#x27;s perspective.<p><i>&quot;These other people are useless, let&#x27;s bypass them.

Waymo self driving works within a defined subset of the problem space, we can stick a goalpost in the sand in term of the known problem space and error rates and say that represents &quot;full self driving&quot; but the reality is the problem space is less bounded than we&#x27;d like to think.

In any field technical terms emerge to avoid ambiguity. Laymen often adopt less accurate definitions from popular culture. LLMs do qualify as AI, even if not according to the oversimplified &quot;AI&quot; some laymen refer to.<p>It has been argued for the last several decades that every advance which was an AI advance according to AI researchers and AI textbooks was not in fact AI.  This is because the laymen have a stupid definition of what constitutes an AI.  It isn&#x27;t because the field hasn&#x27;t made any progress, but instead because people outside the field lack the sophistication to make coherent statements when discussing the field because their definitions are incoherent nonsense derived from fiction.<p>&gt; They are a GREAT statistical parlor trick for people that don&#x27;t understand statistics though.<p>The people who believe that LLMs constitute AI in a formal sense of the word aren&#x27;t statistically illiterate.  AIMA covers statistics extensively: chapter 12 is on Quantifying Uncertainty, 13 on Probabilistic Reasoning, 14 on Probabilistic Reasoning Over Time, 15 on Probabilistic Programming, and 20 on Learning Probabilistic Models.<p>Notably, in some of these chapters probability is proven to be optimal and sensible;  far from being a parlor trick it can be shown with mathematical rigor that failing to abide by its strictures is not optimal.  The ontological commitments of probability theory are quite reasonable;  they&#x27;re the same commitments logic makes.  That we model accordingly isn&#x27;t a parlor trick, but a reasonable and rational choice with ledger arguments proving that failing to do so would lead to regret.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39086696" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39086696" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">fragmede</span><span>|</span><a href="#39086384">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39086510">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39086909">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39086964">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39086696">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39086696">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You&#x27;re going to have to spell it out for me.
