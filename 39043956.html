I was born, raised and lived most of my life in Denver, CO. Now, I live in France in a &#x27;single-stair multifamily&#x27;.<p>Growing up I mostly lived in single family homes, but in college my dad moved into a townhouse and I lived with him for a couple years.<p>Before moving to France, my wife and I lived in single family homes and a &#x27;5-over-1&#x27; apartment.<p>Now, we live on the 7th floor, end-unit of an apartment building. It&#x27;s a &#x27;single-stair multifamily,&#x27; &#x27;floor-through&#x27; apartment (thankfully with an elevator). Meaning our apartment a large balcony one one side and windows on three sides. The only side without a window leads to the stairwell. Every room has a window, even the bathroom and toilet (often separated in France).<p>Without a doubt, this place is one of the best types of housing I&#x27;ve ever occupied. In the summer we can open up windows on either side of the apartment and get a fantastic breeze. The concrete structure does a great job regulating the temperature for most of the year. We get sunlight in the morning and evening.<p>I hate yardwork and there&#x27;s none to do. No sidewalks to shovel snow from either. I also experience neighborliness on par with most single family homes. Very similar to my dad&#x27;s townhouse actually (probably not by coincidence if you think about the incentive structures).<p>We have a 5 year old son and we don&#x27;t miss having a yard. There are parks nearby with playgrounds and paths where he can safely ride his bike without worrying about any cars.<p>Admittedly, I do miss having barbecues in the backyard. I also miss having a garage to use as a workshop.<p>The 5-over-1, on the other hand, was easily the <i>worst</i> type of housing I&#x27;ve occupied. Poor lighting, anonymous, ugly corridors. No sense of neighborliness. Poorly maintained and constructed. Nowhere near a good park without walking along a nasty arterial surface street.<p>I frequently ask myself, &#x27;why can&#x27;t we have <i>this</i> in the States?!&#x27; and now I know why. Building codes, zoning and city planners strike again.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39045214" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39045214" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">adameasterling</span><span>|</span><a href="#39052633">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39052476">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39045214">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39045214">[113 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is a fantastic article.<p>Burdensome regulations on housing construction have caused costs to skyrocket.

But they&#x27;re just as good or better at fighting fires in Europe, and manage to go this with human sized trucks that don&#x27;t require extremely wide streets, wide turn radiuses, and aren&#x27;t nearly as deadly for pedestrians as a result.

The primary killer in structure fires is hydrogen cyanide gas. Wood does emit hydrogen cyanide but the primary source is synthetic materials like upholstered furniture, wall and floor coverings, cabinetry, and other personal belongings.<p>If you have two houses, one made of gypsum-covered 2x4 walls and the other made of stone and steel and a faulty space heater ignites a sofa or some polyester curtains, the buildings are equally lethal. The hydrogen cyanide will have killed you long before the fire burned through the drywall. Non-flammable walls don&#x27;t even necessarily slow a fire&#x27;s spread if synthetic materials are involved. The high heat of by their combustion and their dirty combustion causes flashover which ignites all flammable materials in a given space.<p>I have been a volunteer firefighter for almost 20 years. I have experienced too many fatalities but none of them have ever burned to death. All victims have been dead due to asphyxiation (CO&#x2F;CO2) or cyanide poisoning.<p>The differences in death rates aren&#x27;t as stark as the author contends (for example 0.2 deaths per fire in Great Britain, 0.3 in the US) and my gut tells me the main differentiation between the US and European deaths is the smaller, more compartmentalized nature of European dwellings (which limits the spread of smoke) coupled with their greater level of urbanization which leads to faster emergency services response (the faster a fire is knocked down the less gas it produces).<p>Open floorplans kill.<p>All of that being said, wooden construction does cause more firefighter deaths-- especially if engineered wood is used.

In any case, Grenfell Tower is a nice illustration of how when government provides services like housing, they don&#x27;t magically provide safety.  (Funnily enough, people usually try to spin that tower fire as some failure of the market, when the estate was managed by the local council.)<p>&gt; I know the article makes the point that fire deaths per capita are lower in Europe, which lacks the requirement, but it also notes that US housing stock is also much more wooden and therefore at higher risk to begin with.<p>Btw, this might suggest to change the regulation so that you can either follow the existing US regulations when building with wood; or you get allowed more density and single-stairs etc, when building with whatever they use in Europe.</div><br/><div id="39050432" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39050432" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Tarq0n</span><span>|</span><a href="#39044986">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39050360">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39045699">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39050432">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39050432">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Wood captures carbon within it and has minimal energy cost compared to steel, glass and brick.

And we are sitting on a giant ball of matter, so making more bricks or glass is easy. (Glass can be recycled, but it&#x27;s not really worth it.)<p>You are right that wood captures carbon.  But you have to think about the opportunity costs: the same land that you use to slowly grow your wood could be used to eg run wind turbines or solar panels to replace fossil fuels. (You could also stick a nuclear power plant on that land to replace even more fossil fuels.  But on the margin, nuclear isn&#x27;t really limited by the available land but by red tape and permissions.  So adding a bit more land won&#x27;t make the nuclear industry produce more energy.)<p>You&#x27;d have to run the numbers, it&#x27;s not obvious to me which effect dominates.  Probably also depends on how well wood grows in your climate, and how sunny and windy it is.  And what else you could grow on that land.<p>Speculation: I suspect that emissions during construction will be relatively small fry, compared to the impact of density.  Eg re-inforced concrete allows denser living (by building taller than wood, and by allowing single-stairs to be still firesafe, etc), and density tends to lower per capita CO2.<p>Of course, rural settings won&#x27;t make use of the possibility of density.

You can have varied types right next to each other (one building could house several seniors in small apartments, another could house several young people in smaller apartments, another could be the owner in a two floor &quot;house&quot; on the top to floors with rentals below, another could be a building comprised of entire floor flats that are each owner-occupied).<p>They can be redeveloped so much more easily or repurposed.

I’d be curious how the total costs add up, I’m almost inclined to donate to the guy’s nonprofit just to get the answer to that.<p>I’d be curious how these changes would affect the economics of apartment blocks on huge greenfield suburban tracts, where parking requirements rather than staircase requirements seem to be the limiting factor space-wise. I’m thinking of the kind where space is cheap enough that they do surface lots rather than building parking decks into the structure.

This is especially harmful in cities where many homes are on small, 12-20 ft wide lots.<p>As an example I know people who had to move out of their home when they tore their ACL, whereas with a small elevator they would not need to.

I have a lot to say about the issue, but I&#x27;ll just start with a comment that the place with the highest rate of fires in residences and deaths from these per capita is Mississippi, which has one of the lowest rates of people living in multifamily buildings. In addition to the rural nature of the state, and prevalence of non-professional fire departments in these areas (these two items moot to this discussion), a simple version of the biggest contributors to this outcome are: the housing stock here starts out as poor quality - there are a lot of mobile homes, which have a separate, less restrictive and more dangerous building code. Plus the lack of skilled labor leads to worse initial quality over the entire built sector. The other major factor is lax or nonexistent enforcement of existing building codes and housing regulations. So already poor housing degrades quickly and badly. A relatively wealthy small town I&#x27;m familiar with went two years without a Building Code enforcement official.<p>But in contrast to the average American city, the average &quot;European&quot; city (let&#x27;s just go with the generality) is much more &quot;regulated&quot; in this area. Planning permission is much harder to come by, and questions like whether a building can get by -safely- with a single stair is part of that vetting process. But it&#x27;s very definitely just one aspect of the review.<p>I have extensive experience with California, having worked there for over a decade and even having passed the California Supplemental Exam.  Folks are absolutely 100% correct that environmental and community planning review processes are routinely abused by those with clout to maintain scarcity of the resource they possess. &quot;Those with clout&quot; typically means wealthy homeowners and large developers who want to shut smaller parties out of the process.<p>Anyway, much more to say about this and I might chime in if I get the chance. But I love that the discussion is happening. The system in the US is pretty universally broken. But TL;DR the cause is not as simple as &quot;less regulation good!&quot; or &quot;more regulation good!&quot;</div><br/></div></div><div id="39046464" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39046464" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xnx</span><span>|</span><a href="#39050464">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39051152">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39046464">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39046464">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It would seem sensible if fire codes were something like LEED certifications, where different elements scored different points toward certification.

From what I have seen they apartments (like the article asserts) tend to have much nicer layouts with more light.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39049440" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39049440" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">elzbardico</span><span>|</span><a href="#39045928">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39045186">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39049440">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39049440">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Enclosed stairways are the default in a lot of countries.

In Sweden the U-value (metric units) of a window must be better than 1 W&#x2F;m^2K, Minnesota building standard requires a U-factor (imperial) of better than 0.32 Btu&#x2F;h·ft2·F which corresponds to a U-value (metric units) of 1.82 W&#x2F;m^2K.
