My recollection is that this was a disaster on several fronts, not the least of which was that successfully breaching the HTTP server gave an attacker direct access to the database.  This (and other considerations) make a good case for the kind of separation-of-concerns which would avoid entwining API service with DB access.<p>I read the README, but it focuses on the practical aspects of getting the solution to work, not its philosophical justification.<p>edit: When I say &quot;disaster&quot; for the MS SQL Server attempt, I don&#x27;t believe anyone ever experienced a breach, etc.  But, as I recall, there were no large customers (MS caters to the larger corporate crowd) with IT deparments willing to risk exposing their DB servers to the &quot;DMZ zone&quot; of public Internet access (or only 1 layer past is, such as behind a proxy).  So from that standpoint the disaster was providing a solution nobody (with money and corporate experience) wanted.  I guess for hobbies or Silicon Valley MVPs, the concept might have some legitimate appeal.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37896627" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37896627" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">deep_sea03</span><span>|</span><a href="#37896954">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37895689">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37896627">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37896627">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Oh wow, this is great.

So usually I&#x27;m wanting to move as much work as possible away from the DB in order to squeeze the most out of it before needing to shard the DB or move to a different solution, rather than moving more responsibilities into the DB.<p>- It&#x27;s frankly pretty scary to load a C extension into postgres which is opening ports and parsing requests etc - bugs in it could crash the server or open security holes, and if you were able to exploit a vulnerability you&#x27;d be able to grab any of the data in the DB and easily exfiltrate it. This would be less of an issue if using this for an internal service which isn&#x27;t directly exposed to the internet, but it still could make it easier for an attacker to escalate their access. (This isn&#x27;t a &#x27;it should be rust&#x27; comment really, even if this was in rust it would still be pretty worrying).<p>- Even if think you only need simple CRUD actions, over time you tend to need more and more logic around those actions. Authentication, verification, triggering processes in other systems, maybe you make schema changes and need to adapt requests from old clients, etc.  It&#x27;s really nice to have a more heavyweight application server where you can implement that logic - I&#x27;m pretty skeptical that row level permissions, triggers etc will be able to cleanly handle all those as you add new requirements over time. This applies also to other tools for more directly exposing your DB ( e.g. PostgREST ). IMO starting off using a tool like this is really just setting you up to have to do a pretty painful rebuild later on.<p>Am I missing something here, maybe I have misunderstood the intended use case?</div><br/><div id="37896606" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37896606" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lovasoa</span><span>|</span><a href="#37896392">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37894938">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37896606">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37896606">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">These are good points, but I&#x27;d like to nuance some of them. Disclaimer: I work on an SQL web application builder [1] that shares a lot of the philosophy behind Omnigres.<p>- about scaling: you have to get very far before saturating a single postgres server. A lot of applications certainly do get to that point, but most don&#x27;t. And once you get there, scaling postgres is definitely more work than scaling a stateless service, but it also gives you a lot more in terms of performance, reliability and further scalability.<p>- about C being scary: as a rust afficionado, I am not going to contradict you. But postgres itself is already C, and @yrashk is not just any C developer. Notably, he contributes to postgres itself.<p>- about managing complexity: postgREST, Omnigres, hasura, SQLPage and other tools that simplify building directly on top of the database never require exclusive access to the database. You can always put some of the complexity outside if you need to, when you need to.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sql.ophir.dev" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sql.ophir.dev</a></div><br/><div id="37897266" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37897266" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jordanthoms</span><span>|</span><a href="#37896392">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37896606">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37896741">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37897266">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37897266">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">[delayed]</div><br/></div></div><div id="37896741" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37896741" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">factormeta</span><span>|</span><a href="#37896392">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37896606">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37897266">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37894938">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37896741">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37896741">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;- about scaling: you have to get very far before saturating a single postgres server.

Mostly when postgres as a platform is brought up, the horizontally scaling ppl will often mention the parent thread. I have being developing since Apple computer had floppy disk, and there is rarely many situations where I need to saturating a single postgres server.<p>And even if one did get to the situation where that happens, with introduction of hydra, or other postgers columnar db, we can just put that in. Most user will never get to a point where they need to saturating a single postgres server.
