It makes the accuser look bad and worth avoiding, whilst having no effect on the reputation of the supposed guilty party.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36443701" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36443701" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">invig</span><span>|</span><a href="#36443912">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36443826">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36443701">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36443701">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">WTF are they even trying to say in this article?</div><br/><div id="36443727" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36443727" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">camdenlock</span><span>|</span><a href="#36443701">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36443718">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36443826">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36443727">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36443727">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Roughly summarized, they’re afraid that these popular models won’t exclusively push their preferred ideology (critical social justice)</div><br/><div id="36444011" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36444011" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">delusional</span><span>|</span><a href="#36443701">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36443727">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36443826">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36444011">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36444011">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What is &quot;critical social justice&quot;?
