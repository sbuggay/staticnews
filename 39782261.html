I ended up with a degree in electrical engineering, though I was probably on that path anyway.<p>The highlight was when I was futzing with a slow oscillator and accidentally discovered that using using the speaker transformer as a voltage step up I could get the inductive voltage spike when the relay switched to give a painful shock.<p>I wrote down that wiring diagram so I wouldn&#x27;t lose it. One of my brothers had built a 9V variable power supply in a high school shop class, so we made use of that to create a pain game: hold the two leads and turn up the 9V supply output until you gave up. Whoever got the voltage knob the highest won. Our arm muscles would be involuntarily twitching, like a TENS unit.<p>The other game was one person would hide it in the house somewhere, say a closet, and the other person would use an AM radio to locate it, as the spike would release broadband RF energy which could be picked up by the radio. The closer one was the louder the clicking would come out of the speaker.</div><br/><div id="39822172" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39822172" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">JohnFen</span><span>|</span><a href="#39821388">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39822691">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39822172">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39822172">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Oh, boy, I had that 65-in-1 set too.

It was really helpful for learning basic circuits, but while it had a number of more advanced circuits, including three of four AM radio receivers, and a transmitter or two, I never really learned anything from those circuits despite reading the book a half dozen times. Looking at the 150 in one manual, the first transistor circuit is a basic small signal amplifier with the base connected to a coil. And now with a formal EE&#x2F;CpE education, I can understand how&#x2F;why it works and the biasing resistors, but I&#x27;m just as convinced that the book is largely useless except as a toy beyond the first dozen or two circuits because it doesn&#x27;t do anything to explain the hows and whys of the circuits.<p>The modern equivalent of course are Snap Circuits <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elenco.com&#x2F;snapcircuits&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elenco.com&#x2F;snapcircuits&#x2F;</a> but having purchased one of the larger kits for my kids a couple years back I think they suffer from the same basic problem. Sure telling 10 year old me about BJT biasing might have been a bit much, but I really think it should have been included in some kind of side note even if it doesn&#x27;t sink in the first time.<p>PS: Actually thinking back on it, these spring board ones are probably better from the perspective that a blown component was easy to replace simply by pulling out the cardboard flipping it over and disconnecting the component from the springs underside.</div><br/><div id="39822466" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39822466" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dunham</span><span>|</span><a href="#39822174">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39824370">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39822466">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39822466">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I was frustrated that a lot of the snap circuits sets that we&#x27;ve gotten hide the interesting stuff inside magic components.
