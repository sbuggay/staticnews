That was the whole point of it. It wasn&#x27;t an &quot;OS&quot; per se; DOS was the OS. Windows was what a Linux-head would think of as a combination of an X server and window manager. And Windows loaded your &quot;application&quot; as essentially a DLL, with the Windows global event loop calling into your application&#x27;s event-loop delegate handler (WndProc) whenever it has an interesting event that your application might like to react to.<p>(Your application wasn&#x27;t even a &quot;process&quot; per se. Until Windows 95, everything was just happening in one shared address space, in real mode. In fact, it was only in Windows 3.1 where user applications stopped running in ring 0!)<p>If you think about it, this &quot;the kernel is a game engine and your application is the game&quot; approach isn&#x27;t necessarily a <i>bad</i> design... for a single-tasking OS&#x27;s library exokernel, like the Wii&#x27;s <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiibrew.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;IOS" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiibrew.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;IOS</a>.<p>But, of course, Windows claimed to be a multitasking OS. But it actually wasn&#x27;t! And I don&#x27;t mean the obvious thing about it not having pre-emption. Lots of multitasking OSes didn&#x27;t have pre-emption.<p>No, what I mean is that the concurrency primitive for the cooperative scheduling wasn&#x27;t the &quot;task&quot; (i.e. the process or thread. Which, again, there weren&#x27;t any of.) Instead, the concurrency primitive was the <i>window</i>. Until Windows 95, Windows was a multi-<i>windowing</i> OS.<p>Each control was owned by a window. Each window had a WndProc. If your Windows executable (i.e. application delegate module) set up two windows, then each window participated separately in the global Windows event loop, up-to-and-including things like having its own set of loaded fonts, its own clipboard state, and its own <i>interned strings table</i>. In OOP terms†, your application was just a dead &quot;class object&quot;, running no logic of its own save for one-time load and unload hooks. It was the windows themselves that were the &quot;instances&quot; of your class.<p>This might make you realize why MDI (or Multiple Document Interface, where there are multiple small per-document &quot;windows&quot; inside one big window) was so popular back then. The MDI &quot;windows&quot; weren&#x27;t actually windows — they didn&#x27;t have their own WndProc. They were just controls, like a tab view is a control. Only the big container window was a real window, and so all the <i>resources</i> within that big window were shared between all the virtual windows. MDI was a memory-saving trick!<p>---<p>† The actual more interesting analogy is that Windows was essentially a (single-threaded, cooperatively-scheduled) <i>actor system</i>, where windows were the actors. There is a very close parallel between (Windows 3.1 executables, Windows 3.1 windows) and (Erlang modules, Erlang processes).</div><br/><div id="36034983" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36034983" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Stratoscope</span><span>|</span><a href="#36031183">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36034437">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36035542">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36034983">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36034983">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>This might make you realize why MDI (or Multiple Document Interface, where there are multiple small per-document &quot;windows&quot; inside one big window) was so popular back then.

So here we go...<p>In traditional Windows applications, none of those are child windows (or child controls, same thing). They are all part of the &quot;non-client area&quot;. You may recall there being a whole series of WM_NC... messages like WM_NCMOUSEMOVE and WM_NCPAINT, with the same names as your usual messages except for the NC prefix. Your WndProc would receive all of these messages, but generally would just pass them along to DefWindowProc which handled this &quot;non-client&quot; activity.<p>Now here is the fun fact. OS&#x2F;2 Presentation Manager took a different and cleaner approach. It removed the &quot;non-client area&quot; concept entirely, along with all those messages. Instead, all of those window doo-dads were child windows. The minimize button was a child window. Your &quot;client area&quot; was a child window. And so on. It was all child windows.<p>On this point:<p>&gt; <i>implementing behaviors that seem like their own child controls, but which are actually parts of the MDI child&#x27;s own geometry, to reduce the number of event loops that need to be pumped.</i><p>To be clear, a typical application had only one event loop. It was your classic GetMessage&#x2F;TranslateMessage&#x2F;DispatchMessage loop. DispatchMessage would pass the message off to whatever WndProc it should be directed to.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36035542" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36035542" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">AshamedCaptain</span><span>|</span><a href="#36031183">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36034437">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36034983">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36038895">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36035542">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36035542">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Until Windows 95, everything was just happening in one shared address space, in real mode.

Surely there are processes&#x2F;tasks in 3.x -- you can launch multiple instances of a module, each of them can allocate memory separately, each of them have different resources&#x2F;handles, and the OS will cleanup for you once each instance terminates (cleanly). Obviously, without any type of virtual address space or memory protection, any such process can write to and destroy the memory of any other process, but they are still processes.

(Note there are no threads in 3.x).<p>Many platforms (that either predate VM or decide not to use VM for e.g. power usage concerns) worked like this. MacOS, Windows CE, PalmOS, etc.</div><br/><div id="36038431" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36038431" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">derefr</span><span>|</span><a href="#36031183">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36035542">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36038895">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36038431">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36038431">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; you can launch multiple instances of a module, each of them can allocate memory separately<p>I don&#x27;t think this is true, though? You&#x27;re not getting separate <i>processes</i>; you&#x27;re just getting separate <i>hInstances</i>. Which don&#x27;t map cleanly to a process-like abstraction.<p>Consider: while you <i>can</i> (in theory) spawn multiple copies of a Win16 executable, with each spawn getting its own hInstance and therefore its own locals heap, this isn&#x27;t an inherent part of Win16&#x27;s architecture, but rather is something specific to its handling of spawning executables. <i>DLLs</i> weren&#x27;t included in this handling, and so only get <i>one</i> hInstance+heap each. This means that if you load and call into the same DLL from two separate actively-running Win16 programs, then that DLL must juggle any state it wants to keep for its N active callers on its own single heap. A function call crossing semantically-distinct memory protection domains, without any kind of IPC serialization, is not very &quot;process&quot;-y. It&#x27;s more of an object system, like the JVM.<p>(In both Windows and the JVM: each &quot;object&quot; has its own private heap, and a module wrapping access to that heap; and <i>some</i> &quot;objects&quot; additionally have their own concurrent execution thread. But a given execution thread isn&#x27;t &quot;bottled up in&quot; a particular heap; it just has a &quot;home&quot; heap. If an execution thread calls another object&#x27;s API, then that execution thread, through that API, manipulates that other object&#x27;s heap. There&#x27;s no concept of IPC — of manipulations of other objects&#x27; heaps requiring you to ask <i>the other object whose execution thread owns that heap</i> to do the manipulation for you.)<p>&gt; The existence of Yield&#x2F;DirectedYield , which do not take&#x2F;need a window, is also a hint of that.<p>DirectedYield is an attempt to make Windows tasks <i>seem</i> to act like &quot;processes&quot;... in the Communicating Sequential Processes sense, at least.<p>But it doesn&#x27;t really accomplish this. From the <i>Windows 3.1 API Reference Guide</i>:<p>&gt; If an application uses DirectedYield for a task with no events scheduled,
the task will not be executed. Instead, Windows searches the task queue.
In some cases, however, you may want the application to force a specific
task to be scheduled. The application can do this by calling the
PostAppMessage function, specifying a WM_NULL message identifier.
Then, when the application calls DirectedYield, the scheduler will run the
task regardless of the task&#x27;s event status.<p>In other words, what&#x27;s really acting as CSPs here, are the windows. :)</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36038895" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36038895" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mananaysiempre</span><span>|</span><a href="#36031183">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36034437">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36035542">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36030782">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36038895">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36038895">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; That was the whole point of it. It wasn&#x27;t an &quot;OS&quot; per se; DOS was the OS. Windows was what a Linux-head would think of as a combination of an X server and window manager.<p>This seems like a very post-3.0 (i.e. 386-only) view of things—the 8086 and 286 versions of Windows were also fairly advanced memory allocator&#x2F;overlay manager hybrids.<p>They parcelled out memory, compacted it to avoid external fragmentation (take that, dlmalloc!), expelled pieces that could be read back from executables, and discarded segments that the application programmer said could be recovered, as necessary. (Yet they couldn’t actually <i>swap</i> mutable memory, as far as I can tell. Why?) For data, they required your cooperation by only revealing addresses between *Lock and *Unlock calls and requiring you to store handle+offset pairs otherwise; for code, the 8086 kernel would <i>reach into your stack and walk the frame pointer chains</i> in order to redirect return addresses to swap-in thunks. (Maintaining LRU lists along the way in either case.) Things became better on the 286 when it could just hand out segment selectors and arrange for accesses to fault as required, but this is the problem statement that Windows 1.0, running on the 8086, set out for itself.<p>Now, none of this is impossibly difficult (although I shudder at the thought of doing it without good debugging tools), but it feels pretty damn OS-like to me. You might argue there isn’t much virtualization of hardware going on—except for RAM, CPU, display, keyboard, and mouse—but I’d say there is at least as much of it in Win16 as there is in DOS.<p>One would hope things would get easier on the 386. And then one gets to DPMI and VDMs and still wants to support 16-bit drivers that hooked BIOS calls as though that would help and now the system cannot interact with the user while it’s formatting a floppy[1].<p>&gt; [T]he concurrency primitive wasn’t the “task” [but instead] the window. Until Windows 95, Windows was a multi-<i>windowing</i> OS. [... E]ach window participated separately in the global Windows event loop, up-to-and-including things like having its own set of loaded fonts, its own clipboard state, and its own <i>interned strings table</i>. In OOP terms†, your application was just a dead &quot;class object&quot;, running no logic of its own save for one-time load and unload hooks.<p>That... doesn’t sound correct on the implementation level. If you’re an instance of a Win16 executable module, you own a copy of your executable image’s mutable data, you own your memory allocations (that are not marked GMEM_SHARE), you own a stack, <i>you</i> get all (“posted”, i.e. asynchronous) messages for all windows you (or your library dependencies) created and <i>you</i> ask the system to munge and route them to the message dispatch routines of the windows you created—or not, if you don’t want to.<p>Now, the overall <i>effect</i> is very much like what you described, and often it may feel that you could as well throw out all those tedious GetMessage-TranslateMessage-DispatchMessage loops and replace them with a standard implementation of a vat[2]. Then a puny message handler decides to hijack the whole thing and go into a modal dialog loop. And damned if I could describe what that means in terms of an object model.<p>(What would you say about Symbian? Now there’s a system that throws out processes and only runs objects. Except it doesn’t run inside of a DOS or anything; there’s a kernel and on top of that there are objects. Boom. ... I think?)<p>&gt; The actual more interesting analogy is that Windows was essentially a (single-threaded, cooperatively-scheduled) actor system, where windows were the actors.<p>Yeah, that I’ll wholeheartedly agree with. Nevermind the drawing part, it even has separate synchronous sends (SendMessage) and asynchronous ones (PostMessage)! Of course, unlike E’s[3], these have <i>completely insane</i> interactions with the concurrency parts, especially once you get to Win32.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bytepointer.com&#x2F;resources&#x2F;old_new_thing&#x2F;20090102_002_why_doesnt_windows_95_format_floppy_disks_smoothly.htm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bytepointer.com&#x2F;resources&#x2F;old_new_thing&#x2F;20090102_002_...</a><p>[2] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.erights.org&#x2F;elib&#x2F;concurrency&#x2F;vat.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.erights.org&#x2F;elib&#x2F;concurrency&#x2F;vat.html</a><p>[3] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.erights.org&#x2F;elib&#x2F;concurrency&#x2F;msg-passing.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.erights.org&#x2F;elib&#x2F;concurrency&#x2F;msg-passing.html</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36030782" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36030782" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">devit</span><span>|</span><a href="#36031183">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36029902">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36030782">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36030782">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The article claims that an allocator that splits memory based on allocation size is called a &quot;buddy allocator&quot;.

While there are all kinds of implementation details about addressing and storage and performance and paging and virtual memory, it’s really just an array. The OS gives you a way to reserve pieces of the array for your own use, and you’re responsible for giving them back if you want to play nice and&#x2F;or run for a long time, otherwise (as a safety net) the OS will take them back as soon as you exit.<p>This is, in a sense, very similar to the question you posed. An outer routine owns the outer structure, and an inner routine allocates some inner structure. The simplest, most intuitive, and generally best advice is that whoever allocates is also responsible for freeing memory. In other words, one way to <i>define</i> ownership of memory is by who allocates it. Implicitly and automatically the responsibility to free that memory belongs to owner that allocated it. It’s okay to explicitly transfer ownership, but can easily get complicated and unintuitive. You can also consider letting the parent free your struct to be similar to not calling free() in your JIT compiler - it’s a ‘lazy’ optimization to have the parent clean up - and I don’t mean that in a judgemental sense, I mean it’s valid to let the parent handle it, if you know that it will, and this can be done without getting confused about who owns the memory and who was actually responsible for freeing it. Note that when you leave the parent to clean it up, you are foregoing the ability to re-use the memory - this is true in your JIT compiler and it’s true for malloc() and free() as well. If you let the OS handle it, you’re in effect declaring that you believe you do not need to recycle the memory allocated in your program during it’s execution. (This might be true, and it might stay that way, but it’s always worth asking if it will remain true, since lots of people have been eventually bitten and had to retroactively refactor for memory management when their requirements change.)</div><br/></div></div><div id="36031772" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36031772" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">duped</span><span>|</span><a href="#36029865">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36032188">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36030176">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36031772">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36031772">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; You have to be extra careful when memory is managed by a different language runtime.<p>While it would be <i>nice</i> to have next to no overhead for FFI, it&#x27;s not always tractable.

A page table is just a translation of &quot;pointers&quot; to &quot;memory addresses&quot;; the OS can rearrange physical memory as it sees fit without the program having to update its pointers.<p>In OSes without virtual memory, one option is to do the same non-transparently: instead of returning pointers, malloc and friends work with &quot;pointers to pointers&quot; (called handles), so there is one extra level of indirection, and now the OS is free to rearrange this 2nd level as it sees fit. Whenever a program wants to read&#x2F;write the data behind a handle, it must dereference the handle to get to the real pointer, but it also must let the OS know that it is currently using the real pointer -- this is to avoid the OS moving it around.
This is usually called &quot;locking&#x2F;unlocking&quot; the handle.<p>Some classic examples are Windows 3.x, Mac OS (toolbox), PalmOS, etc.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Classic_Mac_OS_memory_management" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Classic_Mac_OS_memory_manageme...</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="36035222" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36035222" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">alex7734</span><span>|</span><a href="#36035166">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36035992">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36035980">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36035222">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36035222">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">To do that you either need a structure that you update every time a pointer is created, copied, moved or deleted (too much overhead), or you need a way to scan the entire memory

Given that the smallest page on modern architectures is 4k, this would mean using 4k of ram for each allocation (and rounding up each allocation to a 4k page boundary).<p>On top of that, it&#x27;s an OS system call to map and unmap pages, which means you incur a system-call on every allocation and deallocation, which is much slower than using a user-space allocator.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36035793" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36035793" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">samwho</span><span>|</span><a href="#36035166">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36035980">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36035254">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36035793">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36035793">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You’d need cooperation between your malloc implementation and the application code.
