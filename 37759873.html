I even recently reunited with some old friends who chose a more independent career path, and was jealous and nostalgic- they&#x27;re definitely working far closer to their passions with  more freedom than I&#x27;ve felt in a decade.  But man, what a decade since 2013.<p>I would be foolish to dismiss that I had stable employment through Covid, and I still have a paycheck through the current economic turmoil.  I also have my corporate health insurance, which covers my stupidly expensive regular medication which I had no idea I would need in those nostalgic days when these friends chose their alternative careers (I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease in 2015, now in remission thanks to the meds)<p>So I agree with the sentiment that it&#x27;s dangerous (especially to your soul) to just blindly conform and follow the money, but it&#x27;s not always unjustified. In my case it was at least a little bit justified, since my parents were more or less broke and I didn&#x27;t have a safety net.<p>I do wish I had hedged my bets better and been less of a workaholic, of course.

My title, Product Manager, didn&#x27;t exist 30 years ago. I was a developer 20 years ago, and 10 years before that I was managing and supporting a network of 200 Mac Pluses and the like. I&#x27;ve done other things besides, and at no point did the older people where I worked look the way I did years later.<p>I do focus a significant amount of energy on keeping up with the development of technology, and that has changed so much that I couldn&#x27;t help but be different.<p>But I think that applies to everyone working in technology. The developers I work with now are using TypeScript and we organize using Notion. Ten years ago it was PHP and Jira. Ten years before that it was Java and Office docs. Who knows what it will be in ten years, but almost certainly none of those. Two week sprints have been a thing for fifteen years, so maybe that will still be true, but I doubt it.<p>Plan for change.

Your job will change you.&quot;</i><p>Absolute and complete pseudoscientific bullshit. <i>Everything</i> in life changes you. Every. Thing. Your job, the old man that works at the fruit stand around the corner from your flat, the air you breathe. No one thing in your life is going to determine who you are, because your rational, conscious, decision-making brain is what chooses your path in life. Not some amorphous organization or position that supposedly has control over your cognitive pathways. <i>You</i> change you.<p>Go ahead and chase a career. Will your life be any better or worse than if you didn&#x27;t? There is absolutely no way to know that in advance.<p>You know how you discover yourself? By living your life. By self-reflection, by seeking knowledge, and also by flipping a coin and walking wherever the coin leads.<p><i>&quot;Learn three chords, start a band, and go on tour. Ride a bicycle as far as you can. Go WWOOFing or start a community garden in your neighborhood. Put together a traveling puppet show. Build a drone to engage the emerging drones controlled by domestic police. Do whatever — but make it uncomfortable (like leaving prison!) and make it count.&quot;</i><p>Or don&#x27;t. It doesn&#x27;t matter. You are going to become who you are going to be, no matter what you do or don&#x27;t do. You don&#x27;t have to be uncomfortable. Nothing you do has to &quot;count&quot;. It can, if you want. But you don&#x27;t need to live some noble life. Your life doesn&#x27;t have to have meaning. You don&#x27;t have to seek new experiences and become some dynamic, interesting renaissance man. It&#x27;s your life.<p>Here&#x27;s my career advice:<p><i>If</i> you want a career, keep in mind that a career is basically a marathon, whereupon the end goal of the race is to have a high position, good pay, the respect and reference of your peers, interesting work, personal fulfillment, and a fat retirement account. If that&#x27;s what you want, then most of your actions should be centered around becoming likeable, knowledgeable, useful, and constantly preparing for the next step on the path. If you do it really well, you can climb very fast, but that might work against you. If you do it poorly, you can end up not very far, without much money, or references, or prospects, when you need them the most. Careers are largely a political consideration.<p>That said, even with this weird political focus around work, you can still have a personal life that revolves around whatever you want outside of work. You also have a very wide latitude of what kind of work you do, where you do it, who you do it for, what its results are, how long and how hard you do it, etc. There is a very, very wide spectrum of both career, and life, and you don&#x27;t have to fit into anyone&#x27;s mold. You can even give birth to your own career niche.<p>The point of this comment, just like the point of Moxie&#x27;s post, is to tell you that you have options. You can expand your horizons and do all kinds of things that you aren&#x27;t aware of yet. But also know that, no matter where you go or what you do, you are still just who you are. Life doesn&#x27;t get better or worse based on what you do. It&#x27;s your state of mind that makes life worth living. You are not your job.

Love it or hate it, quotes of it probably don’t belong in a LinkedIn-style “here’s some advice kids” article.<p>Moreover, it’s just too easy — low hanging fruit, e.g.<p>Tyler Durden said “once you you lose everything you’re free to do anything” but that’s not right because many activities are expensive and you’ll need money.<p>Yuck.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37761193" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37761193" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">somsak2</span><span>|</span><a href="#37760955">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37761031">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37761485">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37761046">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37761193">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37761193">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Is commenting on HN not a form of self-expression?

You should get skills and a career. I came from lower-middle class and have always had the nagging fear of being destitute. I am so much happier that I worked hard in my 20s (80 hours a week hard) so my 30s and 40s were more comfortable.<p>- Your habits chart your trajectory. If you start working out 3x a week, you will continue doing this and be physically fit. If you drink alcohol 3x a week, you will continue to do this and become wrinkled and grumpy. If you get fired from a job 3x a year, you will continue to have this happen, no matter what your excuse is about why it isn&#x27;t your fault you got fired. Try and work on good habits.<p>- You are the company you keep. Cut out negative people who always are complaining and blaming others. Focus on wholesome, happy, well-rounded, good people who have goals that align with yours.<p>- Your best advocate is yourself. How often do you go out of your way to advocate for other individuals? Don&#x27;t be surprised when no one is putting in the extra effort to help you. Don&#x27;t be a victim - your future is in your hands - don&#x27;t blame others or society for your own failings.<p>- Family, friends, health, purpose are all that truly matter.<p>- No matter what your predicament is, someone has it worse, and someone has it better. You can always be valuable to society. Don&#x27;t let your disabilities and frailties stop you from finding a purpose and way to benefit society.</div><br/><div id="37761114" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37761114" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">drewfis</span><span>|</span><a href="#37760705">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37760730">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37761114">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37761114">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; If you start working out 3x a week, you will continue doing this and be physically fit.

Potentially that could be a sweet spot for sociability and activity. Compared to doing neither 3x a week, what do you think would be better?<p>Both drinking and exercise mean different things to different people. Running a 10k 3x a week with a glass of wine after would be fine. Blacking out 3x a week off cheap vodka while riding the stationary bike would be a different story.</div><br/><div id="37761571" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37761571" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">badpun</span><span>|</span><a href="#37760705">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37761114">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37760730">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37761571">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37761571">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Is the alcohol really necessary?
