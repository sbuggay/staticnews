Not quite passive like a video but not quite interactive like a video game.  The videos could be watched passively but also could incorporate interactive elements like minigames, easter eggs, and choose your own adventure stories.<p>He points out that even when Netflix dipped into the choose your own adventure format they couldn&#x27;t achieve the same flexibility as a flash animation because if for example they wanted to make a story change that would dye a character&#x27;s hair blue they couldn&#x27;t possibly film all the permutations scenes required to propagate that visual difference throughout the story.<p>But in flash animation you can.

The exception was that you could use WebKit to run JS in a webpage in your app. I guess their excuse was security, so they could ensure the app they approved was the one you ran. In 2017 [2] they loosened it further to allowing downloading or importing code in some circumstances. The most important limitation now is that you can&#x27;t generate executable code on iOS, which disallows JITs and makes everything other than WebKit a second-class citizen.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;playcontrol.net&#x2F;ewing&#x2F;jibberjabber&#x2F;apple-ios-license-term-chan.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;playcontrol.net&#x2F;ewing&#x2F;jibberjabber&#x2F;apple-ios-license...</a><p>The old terms:

This is specifically to keep Unity off the Flash platform. This, predictably, causes huge backlash from Flash developers - even those who don&#x27;t care about cross-compilation. So they kill the revshare... as well as any plans to fix Flash Player&#x27;s problems.<p>This all happened a year <i>after</i> Steve Jobs posted &quot;Thoughts on Flash&quot; and tried to ban Adobe AIR apps - and all other third-party development tools in the process[0]. We&#x27;d learn way later on that preceding this, Apple had begged Adobe to ship them a Flash Player build that would actually work on iPhones, and their attempts were... anemic[1].<p>[0] This was only stopped because the Obama administration threatened an antitrust lawsuit.<p>[1] While the iOS ports of Flash Player haven&#x27;t been publicly released, they did ship NPAPI Flash plugins on Android, which were just as bad as Jobs had claimed.

What you describe is correct as far as I can remember, though I hadn’t heard the Apple “begged” Adobe to support iPhone.<p>I know that Adobe shared the Flash Player source code with Apple, but heard Apple assigned an intern to try porting it to iPhone. The Adobe developer working with Apple told me the ported code Apple sent back to Adobe didn’t even compile, so we don’t know if they even tested it on a real iPhone. We jokingly called the iPhone port “Project Boomerang” because the code that came back was basically the same that we sent them. :)<p>The Flash Player’s source code  was ugly, but you have to remember that its roots trace back before Macromedia to SmartSketch, a vector drawing application for the PenPoint OS in the early 1990s. The core rendering and scripting code has since been ported and squeezed into new platforms and applications. And then the dot com boom happened. The development team grew to about a hundred developers and no one person understood the entire code base. Code was copy&#x2F;pasted freely for fear of introducing regressions that would break existing Flash content.<p>Multiple rewrites and grand new engines that would live alongside the legacy engine were attempted but failed due to backwards compatibility, the second system effect, and product management’s pressure for new features.<p>To make matters more challenging, Adobe was losing interest in funding Flash development because revenue didn’t scale with Flash Player usage, only with sales of the Flash authoring tool to a small audience of Flash content creators. That’s when rev share schemes for 3D APIs, DRM, and asm.js-like C++ cross compilation (Alchemy and CrossBridge) were hatched.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36731024" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36731024" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cubefox</span><span>|</span><a href="#36730018">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36730911">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36732094">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36731114">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36731024">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36731024">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t quite get why the Flash plugins were do slow on mobile.

Hell, iPhones still have dedicated JPEG decoders in them.<p>And vector rendering on GPUs is a pain to do, even more so with Flash Player&#x27;s rendering quirks. Adobe&#x27;s official solution to hardware rendering on Flash was Starling Framework, which rendered all your assets to bitmap textures and then gave you a DisplayObject-compatible API that triggered Stage3D renders under the hood.<p>In Ruffle we use a tesselation library to render on GPU.

The first Flash that could do something non-trivial was Flash 5, released some time in 2000 and by that time Flash domination had already been established.<p>The secret was in its authoring tools and the concept of timelines. Basically, you inserted &quot;key frames&quot; and Flash interpolated between them automatically. So if you need to draw a triangle moving from point A to point B, you just add it to the timeline at the starting position, then move down the timeline, insert a key frame and drag the triangle to point B.<p>And these timelines can be composed, looped, triggered by scripts, etc.<p>Here&#x27;s an example video that shows that: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=NOPCPZO5YOA">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=NOPCPZO5YOA</a><p>And that&#x27;s it.
