I work in finance, almost everything is through third party recruiters and there are two reasons for this.<p>1. We are only allowed to hire through either an approved recruiter or the company job portal. The company job portal gets so many applications for each job it&#x27;s absurd, and we have to sift these ourselves to some degree (HR are meant to confirm we only see qualified candidates, but they&#x27;re idiots) so rather than sifting the portal applications we mostly use 2-5 known recruiters who only give us candidates who can do the job. They do the first screenings, if they give us shit candidates we never use them again, so we rarely get a bad candidate through them.<p>2. Perks. We often meet directly with recruiters in person, and they have expense accounts and take us for lunch&#x2F;drinks we don&#x27;t have to pay for. This makes us want to keep using them over direct applications (yes recruiters, this 100% works, we won&#x27;t use you if you&#x27;re shit regardless but we&#x27;ll 100% entertain looking at your candidates if you take us for lunch or drinks - check compliance limits before suggesting a venue though).</div><br/></div></div><div id="36904459" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36904459" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">herodotusxviii</span><span>|</span><a href="#36903624">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36904382">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36904357">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36904459">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36904459">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If you don&#x27;t mind, could you tell me how I should go about finding a recruiter directly on LinkedIn?

Getting an in-house person on your side certainly is a great way to speed along the hiring process, but I&#x27;ve literally never had a third party recruiter send anything my way that ever came close to working out.  It&#x27;s gotten to the point where if I get an email from a 3rd party recruiter, I just don&#x27;t look at it -- although I&#x27;m not sure if taking a chance on one of them at this point is a higher percentage play than 100 cold applications, TBH.<p>I suspect a lot of it has to do with the type of companies that tend to hire 3rd party recruiters.  Namely, startups, and typically early stage startups who don&#x27;t have any in-house recruiting staff.  There&#x27;s nothing at all wrong with early stage startup companies, except that my experience seems to indicate they don&#x27;t actually know what they&#x27;re even looking for.  That&#x27;s in addition to the likelihood that they just haven&#x27;t been around long enough to develop a structured hiring process.<p>I don&#x27;t know.  What I will say is that your incentives and a 3rd party recruiter&#x27;s are not the same.  They want to place you quickly and get the commission, regardless if it&#x27;s the best company or the most competitive offer.  You&#x27;re right that they do want to keep you at least somewhat happy, because if they get a reputation for treating candidates badly, that can be fatal in their profession.  But, the people they <i>really</i> want to keep happy are the ones writing the checks.  And, in this situation, that ain&#x27;t you.  You are quite literally the product here.</div><br/><div id="36904333" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36904333" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lordnacho</span><span>|</span><a href="#36903624">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36904218">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36904243">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36904333">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36904333">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">3rd party recs aren&#x27;t entirely aligned with either the employee or the employer, but that fat cheque is a massive incentive that makes things happen. I&#x27;ve heard of recruiters who placed portfolio managers and ended up getting seven figures due to the compensation arrangement.<p>The thing about 3rd parties is they are really useful if you&#x27;re already on the inside. If you have all the relevant CV points, they will get you interviews. This is the flip side of why people get ghosted by them: if they don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be easy to place, they won&#x27;t bother with you, and in fact they think the employers will stop taking their calls if they push the wrong CVs.<p>Another thing about recruitment is that not everyone is good at it. There&#x27;s a lot of young ones just out of uni who give it a shot, and suck at it. Badly organised, don&#x27;t know the business, waste a lot time for a lot of people. I&#x27;ve got a bunch of LinkedIn contacts who are in various unrelated businesses because they started off in recruitment and couldn&#x27;t bill enough to stay there. If you don&#x27;t field a lot of calls the ones you do talk to might be these noobs who are looking for leads.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36904243" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36904243" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">robbick</span><span>|</span><a href="#36903624">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36904218">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36904333">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36904139">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36904243">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36904243">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I have had some good experiences with 3rd party recruiters.

- Can you give an example of a project or initiative that you spearheaded and the impact it had on the company or team?
- How do you prioritize and manage your tasks and responsibilities when faced with competing demands or tight deadlines?<p>I answered these questions on my own in a notes app, and then when she would ask me I would then draw on my previous experiences and figure out how to answer question that tells a story as best as possible.<p>This really helped me a lot.<p>One tip I would give is to generate these questions, try copy&#x2F;pasting the job description into ChatGPT and ask it to generate a list of interview questions for that role!

If I really wanted a job I&#x27;d get 30-40 questions prepared, from job specific to behavioral (&quot;tell me of a time you had to deal with a difficult stakeholder&quot;). Then add variations of the question so you get used to being asked the same thing different ways.<p>Then always use STAR (situation&#x2F;task&#x2F;action&#x2F;result) to answer the question.

And, given that the candidate pool has been recently enriched with people who were recently employed and would not normally be out on the job market (remember, these are &quot;more or less qualified&quot; candidates, at least according to their resumes), I have a hard time believing the disconnect isn&#x27;t that companies either think it&#x27;s a good time to go unicorn hunting, or they don&#x27;t actually want to hire at all for some reason.<p>But, again, unicorn hunting only works out in a tiny percentage of cases, because the supply of unicorns is low, and the <i>real</i> unicorns probably are not the ones out there pounding the pavement.

It lasted about 40 mins. Now, I can say, hand on heart, that in all my 20+ years of work that has never happened. Ever. He didn&#x27;t have a role in mind, just that he wanted a few good candidates to pimp around to his contacts (CTO&#x27;s and such).<p>My experience in the UK has been that you apply for a role you find on JobServe, you phone and chase the agent, and you hope to get through the cattle market, not this US-style agent-works-for-me stuff.<p>The other agent had a role in mind but he also grilled me extensively. Again, never happened before... they usually ask you about the keywords they&#x27;re looking for and that&#x27;s it: call done in 2 mins. This call took over 30 mins.<p>I asked the first guy what was going on as his style was more like the US system where a recruitment agent will work for YOU, and try to get you a role somewhere, whereas the UK model (unless headhunted!) was very much that the agents worked for the companies in question and acted like a CV-buffer to filter out the crap.<p>One of the agents hinted that there are a lot of average candidates out there at the moment looking for a smaller number of roles so they are aggressively filtering them before handing over to the clients.<p>I suspect that there have been a bunch of rejected CV&#x27;s sent to the clients and they&#x27;re now wanting better candidates... either that or agencies are indeed swamped in average candidates (not pissing on them, but if you have avg candidates and good candidates, the avg ones will lose out).<p>Anyway, things are a bit weird in the UK at the moment so I thought I&#x27;d chime in.</div><br/><div id="36903837" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36903837" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">iExploder</span><span>|</span><a href="#36903766">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36904220">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36903837">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36903837">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">as a rule of thumb I ignore all UK agents, they have the attention span of a coked up butterfly. from my experience they try extract as much information out of you (your salary, last company, are they hiring, give me phone number to their manager or hr) and never call even if they scheduled a call. they never update you if the role you applied for have been filled in meantime, you simply get ghosted and your email gets spammed with offers.<p>I would suggest to email directly to a company hr or apply directly through company&#x27;s job portal.

They directly stop you competing with their current candidate, who is probably the highest % cut.<p>2. They indirectly stop you being put forward by other recruiters when you say &quot;oh another recruiter has put me forward&quot; (which they haven&#x27;t, but you have a verbal contract with).<p>So the number of jobs you think you&#x27;re applying to is actually less .<p>If you suspect this is happening (and make sure genuinely it&#x27;s not just a delay in the HR dept first by asking probing questions) call the company and ask them directly, state that the recruiter is being a little slow corresponding and you&#x27;d like to confirm the status of your application.

We heavily tailored our postings to appeal only to people we actually wanted (e.g. were super clear about requirements, or talked extensively about company culture), and we still got dozens of applicants almost right away. And IIRC that was just through Linkedin, I hadn&#x27;t even seen how many applied through other channels.<p>Granted, most of them were mass-sent resumes, but that still crowded any good-fit applicants and made it a pain to look through.<p>For positions at bigger companies, you could easily be competing with hundreds or thousands of mass-sent applications. Even if a human being ever looks at your resume, she&#x27;ll most likely make a decision on whether to throw it away in a few seconds before moving to the next one.<p>At this point I think applying to postings is pretty much dead. Instead, I&#x27;d focus on contacting your past colleagues asking if they know of any openings at their companies.<p>Instead, I&#x27;d suggest:
- Contact your past colleagues if you hadn&#x27;t done so yet.
- If there are relevant conferences or meetups in your area, consider attending.
- Also, look into meetups for groups that might look for someone like you. E.g. if you go to a front-end meetups, you&#x27;re just another guy in the crowd, but at a marketing or local chamber of commerce meetup there might be only a few people with the same skillset. Granted, this one often works better for freelancing, but still.
- A friend of mine found his previous job by contacting people in the field and asking for advice. He moved to a different city right after university, so had no local contacts – I told him to look up people in the companies he wanted to work for, and just message them asking for a short advice call. I think the third person he spoke to recommended him to someone that was hiring. Though the key here was that my friend was only asking for advice on how to get into the industry – but once he spoke with people, it was easy to make a good impression and they kept him in mind next time they heard of an opening.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36903102" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36903102" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">SxC97</span><span>|</span><a href="#36903966">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36904043">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36903102">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36903102">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I posted something similar just a few days ago: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36876485">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36876485</a><p>I worked as a cybersecurity engineer for 2 years and I&#x27;ve applied for over 300 _entry level_ developer jobs over the last few months and still haven&#x27;t heard back from most places.

In my experience, in the UK, the availability of types of jobs is dependant on the city and seniority level. London seems to have the most front end jobs for example.<p>As to how to get hired, although I have succeeded with direct application, recruiters are a very popular way here to get a job, especially in web development.<p>Finding a recruiter you trust to be working close to your interests is important, but not critical. The best recruitment firms I have found through talking to colleagues and managers. Managers often have a strong opinion on which firms refer the best candidates.<p>I expect another angle is the type of company you&#x27;re expecting to get a job at and the compensation level. I&#x27;ve never applied to a FAANG, but I expect all of this advice goes out the window. Perhaps though if it is applying to too-senior jobs that is your problem then talking to a trusted recruiter could be helpful.<p>I don&#x27;t know anything about resume scoring services, but perhaps they are flawed in some way? Your CV could be great for applying to certain types of jobs, but not for the ones you are applying for. I can suggest forwarding it on to someone who you look up to, who is able to give candid, honest thoughts on it. For example the company you were working at may not be a prestigious company or the technology you were using may not contain the keywords that hiring managers often are looking for.<p>You haven&#x27;t given much information so there are many possibilities as to what is going wrong, including ones outside of what I have mentioned.
