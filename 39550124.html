It&#x27;s the performance statistics - you&#x27;re going to grow more often as the app warms up, reach a steady state, and only need to grow under heavier than expected load. And in that case you probably aren&#x27;t going to see performance dominated by time spent waiting to acquire a write lock.<p>The alternative is to dive into the literature on lock-free mpmc queues, which are kind of gnarly to implement. A lot of the literature handwaves ABA problems with stuff like &quot;use hazard pointers and RCU&quot; without correct pseudo code to help you.<p>That&#x27;s why locking in unbounded queues is popular, imo. It&#x27;s not actually inefficient, and the alternatives are arcane enough to avoid. No one is going to understand or trust the code anyway.<p>It&#x27;s worth mentioning that &quot;lock free&quot; means &quot;one task does not prevent other tasks from making progress&quot; and in the case of a bounded queue, you can trivially accomplish that by busy-waiting when the queue is full. This isn&#x27;t appropriate if you need consumers to receive events in the order in which they happen, but you can kind of fix that using an atomic counter (to paraphrase Mike Acton, if you have a safe counter, you have a safe queue) and time stamp events&#x2F;sort on which ones are consumed.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39557750" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39557750" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jayshua</span><span>|</span><a href="#39550776">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39552099">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39558907">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39553758">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39557750">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39557750">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Not sure if it could be extended here, but I&#x27;ve seen a lock free hash map that supported lock free reallocation by allocating new space and moving each entry one by one, either when the entry is accessed or in a separate thread concurrently.

Weak consistency remains really difficult to reason about and even harder to play around with if you primarily work with x86 and there’s very little tooling around to validate that can help you get confidence about whether your code is correct.

  Thread 1 writes the current head to its hazard pointer (using only release semantics, 
  which are weaker than sequentially consistent semantics).
  Thread 1 reads the head of the stack again.
  Thread 2 removes head from the stack, and passes it to the garbage collector thread

  The garbage collector scans the hazard pointers,\ and (because the assignment was not

  1’s hazard pointer pointing to the node.
  The garbage collector deletes the node
  Thread 1 dereferences the node, and segfaults.

My interpretation is that with release semantics for the store, the 2nd read (load) in Thread 1 is actually allowed to be reordered before the release store to the hazard pointer.  But they are not very explicit about it.<p>&gt; So if thread 2 removing the pointer happens first, thread 1 will see a different value on its second read and not attempt to dereference it.<p>Thread 1 will see thread 2&#x27;s remove even with release semantics for that store -- the store has a data dependency on the first load; they cannot be reordered.<p>&gt; If thread 1 writes to its hazard pointer first, the garbage collector is guaranteed to see that value and not delete the node.<p>Yeah, this must be it.

For a regular allocation, the malloc implementation typically caches that for you. Here you have to do your own pooling if you might be frequently creating them.<p>* Using whole pages, and two mappings per ring, is wasteful in terms of not only RAM (often no big deal) but also TLB space (which often turns into significant CPU usage).

If the reader is triggered, it flips a switch that disables the writer temporarily while the buffer contents are persisted.)  In that design I subdivided the ring into several subbuffers (~8).  Each subbuffer has its own equivalent of a watermark.  That way, the valid portion of the ring always starts at the beginning of one of the subbuffers, and the writer could &#x27;free&#x27; the next subbuffer worth of space trivially (without having to scan through old contents record by record).
