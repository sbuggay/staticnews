If we don&#x27;t she gets whiny and somewhat unbearable.<p>I&#x27;m raising a child right now and it&#x27;s pretty simple to observe a few simple patterns:<p>1. if there is stuff in her visible range during any activity that is even mildly interesting she wants it and it distracts from any activity. be it her own scooter, or her own toys lying around. denying her access to it makes her upset.<p>2. if there is any food in her visible range, cookies, fruits, anything, while eating dinner, she wants it and it makes feeding harder. denying access to it will make her upset and scream.<p>3. if there is a screen of any sort or a bright light on she will stare at it. denying her access to it makes her upset unless I turn it off and put my devices away.<p>4. We don&#x27;t have a TV so she enjoys books a lot and we have improved our eating habits which makes it A LOT easier to feed her the same her healthy food.<p>5. Grand parents think they should bring a bunch of gifts every time they visit meaning our place is filled with junk, infinite amounts of clothes and they get upset when they don&#x27;t get to gift it much like the kids that receive them.<p>What I&#x27;m trying to say it that even taking away all the digital distractions, a lot of these simple things are things I and many people around me did not have in abundance as a child.<p>It&#x27;s not just because the digital stuff that attention spans decline. It&#x27;s because EVERYTHING is noisy. Even the children books and toys are flashy and noisy.<p>It&#x27;s not like you wake up one day and have attention or not, it&#x27;s something that is learned over long periods of time.<p>How is any one supposed to grow up learning focus with all that junk around? I think a lot of these things are designed to get attention from children. The toy, book, and even children clothing manufacturers compete with each other on attention, ultimately I would argue with the goal of making the biggest profits.</div><br/><div id="36858141" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36858141" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mlyle</span><span>|</span><a href="#36852119">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36857858">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36858869">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36858141">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36858141">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Small kids struggle with focus, and here it&#x27;s a good thing: they work to expand their environment and explore.<p>And, yes, you&#x27;re totally right: too many toys and other things seem to exist to exploit this in the name of keeping kids quiet for a couple of minutes and extracting money from guardians.  Not to mention the excessive use of tablets and screen time for kids under 5.<p>But I&#x27;m talking about something somewhat different: I know quite a few 17-19 year olds that genuinely want to absorb information, but literally cannot hold focus through a 15 second interruption.  This is way more prevalent now than a few years ago, and it seems to be the students who are obsessed with short-form video that struggle the most.<p>I think all the things you&#x27;re mentioning are relevant, but the big thing is that with mobile devices and short-form content we&#x27;ve created an environment where distraction never lets up.

In the 19th century cocaine started showing up in just about everything. It was used in medicinal tonics, casual drinks like Coca Cola (cocaine + kola nut), and more. People would use it recreationally, employers would give it to their workers, inventors and others (among them, Thomas Edison) would use it to improve their productivity, and more.

This [1] is an entrance exam for Harvard in 1869. It was expected that the applicant would be fluent in Greek, Latin, English, that they would have a exceptional grasp of history and geography across the entire world, be able to carry out complex mathematical calculations, compose geometric proofs, and more. That trend also was the same as you went down to high school and even middle school.<p>The reason the curriculums were like this is that education was largely optional, and so it was designed for the exceptional over-achievers who would voluntarily, with no extrinsic force, opt into such. Now a days education, including tertiary, is designed for anybody with a pulse. And this creates a terrible scenario for overachievers and underachievers alike. The overachievers are bored senseless in lengthy classes because &quot;Yes, I got what you said 40 minutes ago. Why can&#x27;t we move on?&quot; By contrast the underachievers lack the attention span and focus to follow a 50, let alone 90, minute lesson, so struggle even given the much slower pace.<p>A &#x27;TikTok-ified&#x27; education is really just a desire to stop wasting so much time, but we waste that time because of this change in education. And far from creating a nation of scholars - middling or otherwise, this change has instead just created a nation where your barista probably has a college degree, and 6 figures of debt to show for it.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;graphics8.nytimes.com&#x2F;packages&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;education&#x2F;harvardexam.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;graphics8.nytimes.com&#x2F;packages&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;education&#x2F;harvard...</a></div><br/><div id="36859618" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36859618" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jonathanstrange</span><span>|</span><a href="#36852119">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36858543">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36857584">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36859618">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36859618">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I have to disagree. Your example illustrates that the quality demands of Harvard entry have declined and it&#x27;s reasonable to assume that other universities have also become more open, as you claim. You&#x27;re right about that. Universities are less elitist than they used to be.<p>Nevertheless, the overall demands in higher education have increased tremendously and the courses have also become more focused. In most disciplines, what formerly would have counted as a Ph.D. Thesis is nowadays at M.A. level. I&#x27;ve been in committees for hiring postdocs and Ph.D. students in the humanities, and it&#x27;s insane what kind of demands are put on the students. I know some center of excellence in my discipline that (unofficially) requires one publication in a good international journal to be taken into consideration as a Ph.D. student. The majority of postdocs who apply for a one year grant nowadays have CVs that would almost certainly have made them assistant professors 30 years ago. There are also more courses and more subjects to learn because progress in science has accelerated very rapidly. For example, someone who studies CS nowadays will learn proofs in complexity theory that used to be cutting edge research 40 years ago.<p>Overall, I don&#x27;t buy your negative claims. Over-achievers can quickly finish their undergraduate studies and will move on. At most universities it is possible to cram your curriculum and exams and pass &quot;easy&quot; undergraduate courses very quickly. Lack of elitism is an imaginary problem, probably often made up for political reasons. If you want to see real problems, look at the high student fees, accompanying debt, and the resulting desire to focus on practical job skills and overly fast-paced studies. These are detrimental to science, of course.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36857584" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36857584" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">csomar</span><span>|</span><a href="#36852119">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36852440">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36858543">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36858026">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36857584">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36857584">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; You&#x27;re right: the sum total of human knowledge is larger than it has ever been so to reach the boundaries of our understanding requires more learning than ever.

Add to that, things on the internet like Social Media, apps pushing useless notifications all the time, Tiktok, Instagram, Twitter, etc where things are updated very frequently and if you&#x27;re participating on those platforms, it creates somewhat of an urge to keep checking new stuff as it comes.<p>Engineers can choose to have some flexibility, however the managers and upper managers have no breaks, and it kind of sucks for them to zoom in and out of contexts between meetings, and it often makes them lose track of things. If workload is not shared, it very quickly becomes a shitshow altogether. All my managers in my last 3 companies were struggling to keep up with what was going on, and had no rest; they would get pinged about issues even while they were on PTO which seemed inevitable.<p>Other high context-switching jobs may be those of doctors, stock brokers and analysts (they have to keep tracking a million things every day), lawyers, and sales guys. They come with their own way of causing mental overload quite frequently unfortunately.<p>Honestly I feel it&#x27;s the circumstances some of which are in our control that can be adjusted to minimize distractions and remove some of the useless things that we think are not needed at all.

I think we changed our thinking.<p>I think the world has mostly accepted the &quot;good enough&quot; versus &quot;perfect&quot;.  As we all have heard, to become an expert, on average we need to pursue the subject for 10 thousand hours (? Malcolm Gladwell). But, we do not need to spend 20 years practicing. We can obtain &quot;good enough&quot; in a few weeks, or even few hours (obviously depending on the subject).<p>For example, to win the <i>Grand Prix de la baguette de Tradition Française de la Ville de Paris</i> (i.e., French Baguette Competition of Paris), many spend a lifetime perfecting their craft.  I can teach you in a day how to make an edible baguette that the average consumer will enjoy.<p>I think our &quot;attention span&quot; has shifted to &quot;good enough&quot; in many instances.  I do not think this destroyed our attention span capability, it just made it slightly different.<p>Final anecdote to &quot;prove&quot; my point we did not lose our attention.  I have taken ADHD-diagnosed boys to camp and fish. Of the twelve (ages 12-16), only one could not sit patiently and watch the line and bobber for extended period.  He became bored, and started whittling for the same amount of time. Once they returned to &quot;civilization&quot;, they &quot;became&quot; ADHD again.<p>As someone already noted, in my experience humans cannot multitask.

In fact, it often comes with the ability to hyperfocus better than neurotypical minds. ADHD is the inability to regulate focus on specific activities, particularly ones that are boring and not what the individual finds stimulating. Camping and fishing are not what I would typically consider a difficult task to focus on for someone with ADHD. Especially because it’s a physical activity, which are often better suited for an ADHD mind rather than mental tasks that involve being sedentary.<p>Perhaps what you’re unintentionally getting at is people with ADHD are much better suited for specific tasks than neurotypicals, and society is largely set up to favor neurotypicals at the expense of those with ADHD.</div><br/><div id="36855814" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36855814" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">BirdieNZ</span><span>|</span><a href="#36852812">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36854224">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36853913">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36855814">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36855814">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; society is largely set up to favor neurotypicals at the expense of those with ADHD.<p>As someone with diagnosed ADHD, I think this misrepresents ADHD.

It&#x27;s not very enjoyable for me to accept as I&#x27;m reasonably bright, but I&#x27;m mentally disabled in a way that someone of equivalent intelligence without ADHD is not.

I can only speak for my own experience, but I find compared to my neurotypical peers, I am much more capable at learning a breadth of topics. My peers are significantly better at performing 40 three-way matches for invoices in  a work day while I would totally fail at that. But let me make my own video game where I have to learn how to program it, design art, and create music, and I’m great at that! My power comes from the ability to bounce around things depending on what I want to focus on that day. I create an environment for myself where I have dozens of tasks I can do, so that I always have something that will grab my interest.<p>The way this usually plays out in the actual working world is that I struggle with boring, repetitive tasks, but now that my boss knows how I work, he has let me set a more friendly set up and now frequently sees me deliver major changes that would have taken another developer weeks to accomplish given the diversity of tasks I have solved. Meanwhile the other developer is delivering on certain types of tasks I would be much worse at accomplishing. Our team plays to our strengths.<p>I’m great at deeply learning various concepts then hyperfocusing and delivering significant code changes at work. Some days I’ll complete 3 major jira tickets complete with testing because I’m so focused. Now of course there are other days where it’s much harder to get things done. But setting up that environment where I have diverse things to work on lets that aspect of my ADHD shine.<p>I will note that I’m properly medicated and have a great diet that helped a lot. School was always really tough for me. Then I discovered when I was studying for the CPA exam, that I learn much better from books than from a teacher in a classroom. I experienced this again when I self-taught CS.  These days, I view my ADHD as less of a hindrance and more of a different approach. It’s true that it has downsides compared to a neurotypical, but I feel that it absolutely has its upsides as well when in a healthy state.</div><br/><div id="36857867" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36857867" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sersi</span><span>|</span><a href="#36852812">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36856394">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36853913">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36857867">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36857867">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I was going to write the same thing you did. I&#x27;ve been diagnosed with ADHD and while it is a disadvantage for certain things (I&#x27;ve lost quite a bit of money due to invoices not being sent on time to clients as a contractor, fines for not submitting tax on time, etc...), it&#x27;s also been hugely beneficial in other areas.<p>When I was in university, I quickly realized that I had a hard time paying attention to lectures but that I would be passionate about reading the reference books on the various subjects. So I skipped a lot of classes (it was a French engineering school, attendance is not mandatory if your grades are good) and I read all the relevant textbooks. I was studying CS so I was passionate and very interested in what I was reading so I could easily hyperfocus on those books and did very well. On the other hand, if I had been forced to attend lectures instead, I would have not done nearly as well.<p>In my work life, I&#x27;ve been the go to person who solves the hard problems because when I find an interesting problem to work on, I can completely focus on it until I solve it. On the other hand, I have a very hard time dealing with boring repetitive tasks but that&#x27;s why an effective manager makes sure each people play to their strength.<p>So I do take issue with this statement &quot;As someone with diagnosed ADHD, I think this misrepresents ADHD. There&#x27;s no form of society in which ADHD is an advantage; &quot; and &quot;ADHD is a disability, not a difference of ability&quot;. On the contrary, ADHD IS a difference of ability and effectively managing ADHD means finding ways to adapt your life and work life to take advantage of the good sides of ADHD and find workarounds around the problematic aspects of it.<p>I&#x27;m honestly not sure if I&#x27;d have been as successful without ADHD, I would have lost less money for sure but maybe wouldn&#x27;t have earned as much as I did. It would have been less stressful though for the first 36 years before I got diagnosed when I didn&#x27;t understand why I couldn&#x27;t just do certain tasks.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36853913" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36853913" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Terr_</span><span>|</span><a href="#36852812">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36854224">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36858602">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36853913">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36853913">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I think we changed our thinking.

 Jury is still out on this one :)<p>Anyways, over a decade back, I was watching a recording of a musical artist from either the 70s or 80s, and was surprised at the quality of the presentation (audio, music, harmony within the team) and was thinking on the same lines - good vs good enough, and how this team working in the 70s made musical magic.<p>I think the constraints those days made the masters really practice practice practice so that they could be great at the spur of the moment. A lot of people today may be more expert in synthesizing music so they can take a second&#x27;s worth of snippet here, 5 seconds of snippets there, and eventually make something good, but it is all editing and they may not be able to do that live, but the old timey greats had to perform live, and for that they had to be great.<p>I am not saying no one does live music nowadays, quite the contrary, just saying that a lot of great music comes from people who never do live music, and that is because they can afford the luxury of &#x27;editing&#x27; (which is kinda similar to divided attention span).

Not having run seriously in my life, I challenged myself to join my friends for a 10K last year. The training was an unexpected lesson in humility and thought - I could not go for the 10K regardless of how motivated or pumped up I was. I needed to train myself to get there properly… 2 KM on day 1, 5KM by day 15, and 10K by day 30 or so. With enough rest in between.

But also, unlike in the movie where it does the usual swelling soundtrack and post-climax wrap-up like it&#x27;s about to finish but then just continues and does it again, I feel like the book doesn&#x27;t do a literary equivalent of that at all. It doesn&#x27;t feel like multiple endings, but rather multiple conclusions to separate story arcs, which is something the books do all throughout. The book is just forced to cram several right at the end, because it has to finish somehow.

On the site daily for ten years or so. While I didn&#x27;t spend hours on the site per day (though there were some days where I definitely did), I _had_ to visit it every day or I would be irritable.<p>Note that I felt like this despite unsubscribing to every subreddit in favor of multireddits (so that my front page would be empty), not enabling notifications on the site, disabling infinite scroll and having a very limited set of subs in my multis, few of which I&#x27;d consider classic time-wasters (like &#x2F;r&#x2F;consulting, which is mostly consulting memes, or &#x2F;r&#x2F;programmerhumor).<p>A problem with Reddit (for me) is that despite doing all of this, there is essentially infinite content, and all of it is interesting!<p>Since I also browsed Hacker News, what ultimately happened was that I would speed-run HN and Reddit in an attempt to be &quot;caught up&quot; during the &quot;limited free time&quot; I had to myself.<p>Like many here, I quit Reddit cold-turkey a month ago when Reddit committed to their new API pricing strategy and Christian committed to sunsetting Apollo. I figured that it was only a matter of time until Reddit sunsets old.reddit, I had no interest in being forced to use new.reddit, and all of the subs I cared about were (rightfully!) going dark and losing subscribers in the process.<p>Since I browse Hacker News via skimfeed.com (excellent curator) and there are, at most, 15 posts on there at a time, I don&#x27;t spend nearly as much time on &quot;Internet things&quot; as I did before. However, my tolerance for reading (and writing!) long form like this has gone way up! I think this is due to me not feeling as if I need to split my time as aggressively as I did before.<p>I&#x27;m also much more chill about &quot;needing&quot; to browse daily. I still hit up HN every day, but because there is so little to catch up on, I feel like I got much more of my time back now.<p>(One more thing. Reddit, by and large, rewards short, quippy, knee-jerk responses. Longform is typically skipped over. You don&#x27;t have to think very much to use the site. Ironically, it is very easy to scroll through a Reddit thread while also feeling rushed to speed-run through it to get caught up.<p>Very different from HN, where the content is very interesting, and longer comments tend to be upvoted more.)</div><br/></div></div><div id="36852155" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36852155" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">disadvantage</span><span>|</span><a href="#36856380">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36852425">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36852155">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36852155">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; In 2004, in our earliest study, we found that people averaged about one hundred fifty seconds (two and a half minutes) on a computer screen before switching their attention to another screen<p>Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I look at several different screens each day (Phone, Workstation, Raspberry Pi for home network logging using Pi-Hole, and a tablet).

A way to intuitively, instinctively and logically determine if you can get the sense of something quickly. If you sense it is worthy, you will invest the time in it. If not, and you feel you are wasting time, you skip it.<p>Quicker abandonments, glossing, and skipping ahead are all natural human adaptions to the increasing and constant bombardment of data and stimuli we are presented with.  This is why we want the &quot;tl;dr.&quot; This is why you want a 1-minute explainer video instead of a 30-minute or 1-hour lecture.<p>Now, <i>if</i> you catch someone&#x27;s attention, they&#x27;ll follow you down the rabbit hole and will keep reading or watching. Maybe for hours. Look at TikTok lives and Twitch streamers. People doomscroll, next, next, next... but as soon as they encounter the right content — whabam! They will stick there until the livestream ends.<p>Similarly, look at Hacker News itself. If a 1-sentence topic grabs your interest — whabam! You&#x27;ll read the article (which could be thousands of words long) and you may engage in the threads of conversations, which could eat up your day.<p>Oppositely if a content creator bores people or if the audience start to sense what you are talking about is sus, or totally outside their interests, they&#x27;ll just drop it.

I know many and many of their children are medicated for ADHD. They are usually active and healthy boys who don&#x27;t like sitting still in class or have grown accustom to video game and screen time, so when they don&#x27;t have those things, flip out. On demand entertainment and smart phones have created a screwed up reward system for young children. ADHD medication is usually the prescribed solution to that problem. By the time they reach middle school, they have no chance. Its an uphill battle to stay ahead with school and maintain all the hobbies&#x2F;extracurriculars. I blame the parents, and while they&#x27;re responsible, the FDA&#x2F;&quot;doctors&quot;&#x2F;pharma companies facilitate it.<p>I&#x27;m not saying people are faking things like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Mostly ADHD, anxiety, and depression disorders.

Nowhere does it suggest that there is a notable increase in fake diagnosis that results in accessing pharmaceuticals, or that anyone takes a fake diagnosis more seriously than the traditional route.<p>There is zero evidence that there is an increase of people who are diagnosed via short meetings and immediately drugged especially when the drugs are under far heavier restrictions than say Ozempic.<p>The rest is anecdotal, just as easily as you say you&#x27;ve met so many who have been diagnosed and drugged, I can say I have not met many. Most of them seem very anti-diagnosis even when it&#x27;s clearly affecting them due to this stigma. Yet you&#x27;ll discount my position because it&#x27;s anecdotal.<p>If you think your worldview holds water, why are there so many studies proving the efficacy of both non-stimulant and stimulant drugs in trials that are double-blind, placebo controlled, and using parallel groups? (eg <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC3000197&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC3000197&#x2F;</a>) Shouldn&#x27;t it be identical to placebo for reducing ADHD symptoms?<p>Far more interesting to me is how you&#x27;ve met so many neurodivergent people. Many studies have talked about subconscious biases of those who are neurotypical (eg: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC5286449&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC5286449&#x2F;</a>) which goes both ways, as we gravitate to those most similar to us. Unless you&#x27;re a social worker or creating statistical anomalies in your head of course.<p>Are there people out there who have been drugged by their parents without having a real problem? Probably.
