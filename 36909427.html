I think DNS is something few people take the time to learn, but it&#x27;s not actually hard to learn.  One of the great things about DNS is that the system itself will tell you about it&#x27;s internal state in response to queries.  It&#x27;s very easy to inspect a DNS server for a known zone and understand how it works, and there&#x27;s very good tooling that&#x27;s free and widely available to do this (like dig).<p>It&#x27;s always been a big surprise to me that my DNS expertise is what seems to be most memorable for a lot of folks I&#x27;ve worked with through my career, when I don&#x27;t believe I know anything mystical or special.  DNS is extremely well standardized, the most common server and client implementations rigorously follow the standard, and it&#x27;s very easy to inspect with free tooling.  It just takes some effort and time to learn, but it&#x27;s not really hard.</div><br/><div id="36914493" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36914493" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jvns</span><span>|</span><a href="#36910427">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36910841">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36914493">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36914493">[19 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Hello! I wrote this post and I have a couple of things to say about this &quot;DNS is not actually hard&quot; take. It took me many years to feel totally comfortable debugging DNS problems, and I wrote this post to explain why I think it was hard for me.<p>I also used to think that &quot;no, actually, it&#x27;s easy!&quot; was an encouraging response to &quot;this is hard to learn&quot;. And I kind of get it! I love DNS! I think it is surprisingly simple in many ways, and I&#x27;ve written about that a lot, for example in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;implement-dns.wizardzines.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;implement-dns.wizardzines.com</a> which shows you how to implement a toy DNS resolver from scratch in some pretty simple Python code.<p>But over the years I&#x27;ve learned that &quot;no, it&#x27;s easy to learn!&quot;, instead of coming off as an encouraging comment (&quot;you can do it!&quot;), often gets received as &quot;no, it&#x27;s not hard, actually the problem is that you&#x27;re dumb&quot;. Like, I&#x27;ve been confused about this for years, and you&#x27;re telling me that, no, actually it&#x27;s easy? Not that helpful!<p>So I&#x27;ve stopped telling people that, and instead I put a huge amount of work into trying to understand _why_ people find certain things hard and work to help remove some of those barriers.</div><br/><div id="36914710" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36914710" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">anyfoo</span><span>|</span><a href="#36910427">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36914493">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36915827">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36914710">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36914710">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Maybe everyone sees this differently?

When someone does so while also touting their status among their peers due to their knowledge and talking about how anyone could do it by just putting in the work, it&#x27;s not surprising that people might interpret that as implying that people who don&#x27;t have the same knowledge are either too lazy to put in the effort or not capable of it, regardless of whether that was the intended message. If the goal is to try to help people, it&#x27;s more effective to communicate in a way that conveys understanding and not judgment; if someone doesn&#x27;t care to improve their methodology of helping people, that&#x27;s fine, but it does raise more doubts about whether they&#x27;re being honest about their intentions.</div><br/><div id="36916556" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36916556" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zhte415</span><span>|</span><a href="#36910427">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36915410">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36915827">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36916556">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36916556">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Your post reminds me of three things -<p>The nature of what&#x27;s being learnt.  Some things require a continuity - to understand B, prior A is needed (or helps, to understand faster).<p>The method of learning.  Book&#x2F;theory-based, or practical?  For either, what&#x27;s the nature of scaffolding (self, or via resources) to help leap the chasm?  If testing one&#x27;s self, what&#x27;s the complexity and can that complexity be broken down into simpler (or more discrete) parts, (perhaps testing working better in smaller parts)?  Perhaps A isn&#x27;t fully (or at all) required to &#x27;know&#x27; B, depending on how it&#x27;s learnt.  Which goes on to -<p>The nature of the learner (at that point for that task).  Someone that&#x27;s looking to solve a task, somewhat surface, or someone that&#x27;s interested and will go deeper into edge cases or approach with greater curiosity?<p>[I&#x27;m skipping the nature of the learning&#x2F;knowledge, since &#x27;resolving DNS&#x27; is a pretty externally verifiable result.  However it might be fruitful to consider the nature of the learning is not only &#x27;resolving DNS&#x27;, and even if &#x27;resolving DNS&#x27; fails, learning always happens (intended&#x2F;unintended, positive&#x2F;negative, a can of worms there).]<p>You point out that &#x27;easy&#x27; and &#x27;hard&#x27; are motivators that might have unexpected, or the reverse, effects vs. intended, depending on the reader.

The 99% scenario is turning a domain into an IP via an A record. Next after that is doing the same with an MX record.  Beyond that is this deep well of other things people thought someone might want to do with DNS, but that almost nobody takes advantage of in real life.  So DNS is probably easy to understand if you&#x27;re just concerned about the one or two first class scenarios, but if you had to implement an RFC-correct instance of a DNS server, it&#x27;s a bit of a brain melter.</div><br/><div id="36916097" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36916097" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">syntheweave</span><span>|</span><a href="#36910427">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36915827">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36916023">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36916097">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36916097">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is the comment I wanted to make.

I&#x27;m in this latter category with DNS: I get it at a high level, but it&#x27;s like a student who has only done the simple example project.<p>I&#x27;m of the opinion that we&#x27;re at a good moment to redo the things DNS does with better separation of concerns by going towards &quot;put those records on a blockchain, streamline it for known applications, reframe the hard problem around bootstrapping access to on-chain data&quot;.

    4. The defn of &#x27;authoritative&#x27;

One of the reasons I got into design was to try and break chains like this, but talking to the FOSS community about design gets nearly zero traction and a whole lot of pushback from folks who think they know a lot more about design than they do. Nothing you do matches the information density of a train schedule in a large city, and those designs are so ubiquitous and intuitive that we take them for granted. That was not always the case— someone decided to lay things out like that at some point because they knew it works be easier and more intuitive for the majority even if it might take some adjustment for existing everyday users. And designers still work to make them better, to this day.<p>I wrote a tutorial teaching non-technical folks to use a rest API. It required no knowledge beyond familiarity with using web browsers, and ended with people making useful queries with curl. It was short, visual, and effective- I learned that multiple non-profits at the time used it in their materials to teach folks technical literacy.

One of the things that I found out and became more curious about was why DNS was so critical for Active Directory, upon where I discovered the magic of SRV records.  After that I decided I wanted to learn DNS in detail, so I read the RFCs, poked around with nslookup and dig, and then set up a local copy of BIND on a Linux VM to experiment with.  In the numerous intervening years I&#x27;ve picked up more over time and been involved in numerous situations where I had to assist someone by doing DNS spelunking, often learning something in the process.  I jumped from being a help desk monkey to being an L2 sysadmin in my very next job largely on the basis of my DNS and Active Directory knowledge, all of which was learned by reading documentation and poking at things, nothing particularly difficult about either.<p>What always causes challenges is weird edge cases, but if you understand how things are supposed to work at a protocol level you have the basis of knowledge to troubleshoot the edge cases, which is how you learn about the more esoteric or implementation specific behaviors of things.  I wouldn&#x27;t expect anyone to particularly have deep knowledge of AD or DNS edge cases, but the basics of how they work aren&#x27;t particularly hard knowledge to acquire and it&#x27;s a constant surprise to me how few tech people understand DNS in particular, since it&#x27;s a critical system for nearly every aspect of modern computing.<p>As far as resources, when learning these things way back when I only used the official Microsoft documentation, the RFCs, man pages, and sites like nixCraft to learn about it.  These same resources still exist (although Google sucks now and makes anything decent hard to find), and these protocols have changed very little in the intervening nearly 20 years, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any harder for folks to learn today than it was for me back then.  This stuff is very literally not rocket science, DNS is an extremely basic protocol.  In fact, nearly all its weird edge cases is because it&#x27;s such a basic protocol that some behavior isn&#x27;t clearly defined, however &#x2F;most&#x2F; behavior is.  It&#x27;s very nearly all text on the wire, and all of the zone records, queries, and responses are human readable.  As someone else mentioned, you can just use Wireshark and learn about DNS.  It&#x27;s inspectable on the wire, not just through tooling.<p>FWIW, Active Directory is far more difficult to learn in detail than DNS, largely because Kerberos is deeply complex, and Active Directory has many unique complexities (like how FSMO roles work).  DNS in comparison to most other things you are expected to know as even a semi-competent systems administrators &#x2F; SRE is mindbogglingly simple.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36913109" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36913109" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">WarOnPrivacy</span><span>|</span><a href="#36910427">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36911072">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36911272">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36915309">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36913109">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36913109">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Setup an in-house server to sinkhole malware requests.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36915309" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36915309" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">oneplane</span><span>|</span><a href="#36910427">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36913757">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36915309">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36915309">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think the article hits the nail on the head.

Your DNS lookups are basic data - your ISP used to love seeing where you go.  Your OS vendor (if you buy your OS) obviously can pass back &quot;telemetry&quot;.  Mr Google, doesn&#x27;t own the desktop but does own the browser, so by ensuring you use &quot;safe&quot; DNS servers for your browser instead of whatever you have configured, its all good.  All these shenanigans does make IT troubleshooting far more exciting than it used to be.<p>I shouldn&#x27;t worry too much about trailing dots.  You will almost certainly not be using the DNS servers you think you are.  I get why DOH was invented and there is a good reason for some &quot;civilians&quot; to use it - ie a non IT specialist using a nasty wifi hotspot will be protected from some harm by their browser going home securely to do DNS lookups.  However is it up to the browser vendor to trample all over the user&#x27;s choice of Endpoint Security?<p>DNS is way more complicated than simply looking up addresses.

I knew about `dig(1)` and BIND and a CS101 idea of how recursive DNS resolution works, etc.  But I was missing the working knowledge needed for designing and implementing anything non-trivial or for debugging non-working systems.  So I read &quot;DNS and BIND&quot; (not quite cover-to-cover, but close, skipping over the details on some of the more exotic features).  I set up a real BIND server for some unimportant personal web sites.  None of it was hard, but it did involve a bunch of (time) investment.  To be clear, BIND is not the right thing for many use cases, but a lot of DNS ideas and terminology still come from BIND and I found that stuff very valuable.<p>I think books are underappreciated for learning stuff like this.  Most resources you find on the web are high-level theory (&quot;here&#x27;s a block diagram of how recursive lookup works&quot;), task-oriented (&quot;how do I get `dig` to do a recursive lookup&quot;), or otherwise low-level (e.g., reading the source of your local DNS client to understand its retry policy).  To understand the pieces and how they fit together, from the theory (what they&#x27;re trying to achieve) down to implementation (what caches exist where), I find there&#x27;s no substitute for a holistic approach that you usually find in books, but rarely (not never) find on the web.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36910325" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36910325" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gunapologist99</span><span>|</span><a href="#36911509">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36914184">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36910325">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36910325">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s probably a good idea for all IT people to have a working knowledge of how to debug DNS issues.<p>DNS has historically been a vector for <i>significant</i> security holes and it&#x27;s likely that this will continue to be true for the indefinite future.

Those I meet at my current job are... young. The lack of experience shows.<p>I was a stil-at-school dev&#x2F;sysadmin&#x2F;multi-purpose nerd 23 years ago, if that works, nice to meet you!<p>I had more experience than average on some tasks because I was lucky enough that, against my own will, when I was a little kid my parents bought a computer and not a videogame console. I still spent most of my time in front of it playing games, of course, but I also learned to program a little bit, and by the time we had our first PC at home, I also learned troubleshooting because every time I broke it I had to get it working before one of my parents needed it.<p>Other than that, I think school prepared me well in terms of foundations (perhaps better than what some kids see today, at least I&#x27;m surprised how few people who went through formal CS&#x2F;SWE university training recently know enough about the reasons the relational model was introduced, or how operating systems work).<p>On the other hand, practical skills taught at school were not immediately useful to me. In particular, the software stack most used at school (Pascal, then Delphi, we did have some courses using C, Prolog, ASM, COBOL, and SQL, but most of my programming hours in school were spent in Pascal&#x2F;Delphi) was not used in any of the jobs I&#x27;ve had, with the exception of COBOL), so I did a lot of learning on the job.<p>I make a living working on databases now, and I sometimes like to tell the story of how I got into them: while working at a bank, the web banking application had an SQL Server backend database for its frontend (actual banking happened in another network, on a mainframe, I don&#x27;t know which DB it used but it was some IBM thing and it was not DB&#x2F;2). There was a settings table that was basically a key&#x2F;value store controlling different config options of the app. One of them was a maintenance flag which, if set to whatever the value for true was, would show a &quot;we&#x27;re under maintenance&quot; page when serving any user request. One day they asked me to go put the site on maintenance (&quot;go put the site&quot; because I had to go walk upstairs and enter the datacenter to do this back then), so I went to the console, opened the query editor, and entered something like:<p>update settings set value = 1;<p>Notice the lack of a where clause. When I saw the number of rows affected, I panicked, ran downstairs, explained what I had done, and a colleague (who was also young but I think at his second job after school, and way more experienced than me) calmed me down, walked up with me again, showed me where the backups where, and helped me restore one.<p>I&#x27;ve been hooked on databases since that day!</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36910619" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36910619" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xtagon</span><span>|</span><a href="#36909766">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36910343">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36912062">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36910619">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36910619">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The downside to things that &quot;just work&quot; is that they become magical black boxes where learning how they work isn&#x27;t a requirement until things <i>really</i> go wrong.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36912062" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36912062" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">dv_dt</span><span>|</span><a href="#36909766">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36910619">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36911943">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36912062">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36912062">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">DNS concepts are pretty straightforward, but I agree with the article that there are a lot of little holes to fall into.

The article points some of that out (stub resolvers, even different implementations of libc); recursive versus authoritative responses; the recursion process; recursive versus authoritative servers.<p>A lot of deployment implementations are &quot;bottom of the barrel&quot; and aren&#x27;t correct to begin with, although they work for the intended purpose. There is no checklist for server implementations which I am aware of (I&#x27;ve asked where people should know!). There&#x27;s a lot of folklore which persists because if it works it&#x27;s presumed correct.<p>There&#x27;s &quot;DNS&quot; and then there&#x27;s &quot;The DNS&quot;, the &quot;one true root&quot; with arbitrary restrictions on the contents of labels. There&#x27;s political interference with implementations in terms of the &quot;one true root&quot; doctrine, which interferes with marrying a resolver which e.g. queries a control plane and serves an application plane (where they have different roots): there are e.g. notions of forwarded zones, but there is no notion I am aware of of a &quot;always recurse and lie that you&#x27;re authoritative&quot; zone (you can hack source code to accomplish this of course).<p>Even MITRE ATT&amp;CK doesn&#x27;t always get it right. They had it listed that DNSSEC &quot;traffic&quot; had to be examined with SSL tools, until I pointed it out (I didn&#x27;t get credit). DNSSEC related records are ordinary DNS records, nothing is being encrypted.<p>I could go on: the experts were wrong on (UDP) frags, anycast...</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
