The usual rule of thumb is that one extra Sievert = 5% higher risk of dying from cancer, so a 30 mS dose increases death risk about one part in 660.&quot;<p>Sorry but there is a flaw here: calculation seems good but conclusion is completely wrong.<p>Calculation: increased risk ratio of cancer-related death for 30mS = 1.05^0.03S = 1.001465...

If it was X%, the exam brings your risk at X% x 1.0015<p>X depends on the medicine quality in your country, your access to it, your health, your exposure to cancer-triggers (pollution, tobacco, food...), your DNA, your gender...<p>Let&#x27;s state a depressing 1%, then the screening exam brings you to 1.0015%, or +0.0015% additional risk due to the screening exam = 0.000015 = rounded 1&#x2F;67000.

Kind of. Our knowledge of how radiation causes cancer comes primarily from Hiroshima and Nagasaki; we can follow survivors who were one mile, two miles, etc, from the center of the blast, calculate how much radiation exposure they sustained, and see how much cancer they got years later. But by the time we’re dealing with CAT scan levels of radiation, cancer levels are so close to background that it’s hard to adjust for possible confounders. So the first scientists to study the problem just drew a line through their high-radiation data points and extended it to the low radiation levels - ie if 1 Sievert caused one thousand extra cancers, probably 1 milli-Sievert would cause one extra cancer. This is called the Linear Dose No Threshold (LDNT) model, and has become a subject of intense and acrimonious debate. Some people think that at some very small dose, radiation stops being bad for you at all. Other people think maybe at low enough doses radiation is good for you - see this claim that the atomic bomb “elongated lifespan” in survivors far enough away from the blast. If this were true, CTs probably wouldn’t increase cancer risk at all. I didn’t consider myself knowledgeable enough to take a firm position, and I noticed eminent scientists on both sides, so I am using the more cautious estimate here.</div><br/><div id="38034938" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38034938" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chris_va</span><span>|</span><a href="#38034832">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38034858">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38035664">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38034938">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38034938">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There is this story:
