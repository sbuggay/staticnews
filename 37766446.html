So much of this product page is focused on new software functions that may have some vague relationship with the slightly upgraded hardware, but that could mostly be released to existing phones. Every new iPhone, Pixel, or Samsung phone basically claims the camera is marginally better and hey, look at these software features that have very little to do with the hardware and should not fundamentally be a reason to upgrade to this phone.<p>There is so much time, effort, and physical waste that is generated by slightly redesigning phones every year purely for the sake of making sales (as opposed to meaningful improvement upon the existing design or introduction of a new hardware feature). Think not only of people upgrading for the sake of it, but all of the cases, screen protectors, and other assorted accessories cast in plastic for previous models that are garbage now.<p>It would be nice if we could just space these things out to 5 years or so now, because that&#x27;s probably how long it takes for anything to change enough to justify a new model.</div><br/><div id="37770936" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37770936" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">TaylorAlexander</span><span>|</span><a href="#37770779">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37773785">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37770936">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37770936">[109 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s funny because if they did not release a new phone every year, the old phones would be useful for longer. I recently had to replace my iPhone 7s plus because it was getting so slow I sometimes could not get the camera to open as it loaded the system down too much. This was despite the fact that the system said my battery was not degraded (it had been replaced with Apple Care a couple of times).<p>Of course when it was new the camera opened quickly. And then Apple made their OS more heavy weight every year until my phone slowed to a crawl.<p>And faster phones are nice, but I think it is worth considering how valuable that really is to us as users and a society, especially if the process involves making loads and loads of ewaste and consuming tons of new resources, and all the emissions their mining and transport involves, when we could simply keep our software slim and our old devices functional.<p>And the big companies will never do this.

And the older version can be sold to price sensitive customers, so it allows product companies to get higher margins for new products.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37771110" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37771110" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">taway1237</span><span>|</span><a href="#37770779">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37774944">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37772221">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37771110">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37771110">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;m currently using Pixel 4a (just recently EOL), and I&#x27;ll probably upgrade my phone this or next year.<p>Maybe Pixel has a yearly release cycle, but it doesn&#x27;t mean I have to upgrade every year, that would be crazy.

III had a 70--105 mm (which, as most non-prime lenses, was quite soft at the longer range). &quot;You get literally the same detail because 52 MP!&quot; Sure, dude. Now explain why every comparison review of the 5 V telephoto has significantly less detail than even a lowly 3x zoom, even factoring in how 1&#x2F;9th of 52 is 5.8 MP? (Notebookcheck.net supposedly lets you downscale its comparisons to 2 MP and 4 MP, and the closest-to-Xperia-quality but still better shot belongs to the 3x Galaxy S23.)<p>You remember being disappointed when the 1 V bundle was WH-1000XM5 and you already owned well-worn WH-1000XM3s. You&#x27;re even more disappointed when the new 5 bundles inferior cans rather than buds or something wired from Sony&#x27;s Pro Audio division. The 5 price is always the same as the 1 price when the 5 drops in September, so you wonder why not get the 1, which is superior in nearly every way?<p>Oh, right, because you know it only gets one more OS upgrade (Material You: Yuck!) and you probably won&#x27;t get whatever new APK comes standard in the next gen&#x27;s Xperia 1, plus you&#x27;ve already missed your chance to order and resell the bundled headphones, so the now-300-off price of the 1 is just the same that you would&#x27;ve paid by selling the bundle plus a little depreciation.<p>Also, where the hell IS this Pro-I successor? Is _that_ going to have a real telephoto and less of Xperia 5&#x27;s wacky design changes and 4 to 7 years of software support and a screen bright enough to use as a flashlight because, let&#x27;s face it, Sony will close its mobile division before letting its users put more current through the rear LED. Plus, who knows, maybe next year they finally release crimson or that same sweet shade of orange that sits at the base of their true flagship full-frame mirrorless??<p>-----<p>Cost, within reason, is not an issue for me. I would get another Xperia---any model---if it ticked most boxes. My main reason for ignoring Sony as a serious contender? Sony continues to nerf two peripherals or APKs for every one feature they improve, and then I continue to wait for actual improvement while my Zenfone 8 and a6400 slowly age. Every few months, I wonder what phone I would get if I needed a replacement today, and Xperia drops further down the list.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37772658" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37772658" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">izacus</span><span>|</span><a href="#37766531">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37771531">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37776207">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37771498">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37772658">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37772658">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I stopped when they started permanently breaking camera procesing on bootloader unlock.</div><br/><div id="37774387" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37774387" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hparadiz</span><span>|</span><a href="#37766531">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37772658">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37771498">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37774387">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37774387">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I thought they stopped doing that in 2019?</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="37771498" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37771498" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">freedomben</span><span>|</span><a href="#37766531">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37768374">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37771531">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37767519">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37771498">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37771498">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Same, in fact it&#x27;s the reason I buy and continue to buy their products.

It&#x27;s not like the BOM + assembly for a touchscreen, first(!) battery, motherboard, and plastic case cost that much. Check out some of the public reports from counterpointresearch.com: the profit margin on flagships is often double the BOM cost, the profit margin on budget phones is a little tighter but still not bad. Who cares what the revenue is per year? What matters is how much it costs to make the thing.  Most vendors are just tweaking reference designs anyways.<p>The Moto G Play is just $170 list, currently going for ~$110. It has a rather pathetic 3 years support, but that&#x27;s $4.72 per month at list, or ~$3.95  at current list rates - assuming you throw it away when the support contract ends. The Samsung A14 5g is $200, and gets 4 years&#x27; support, which is $4.15&#x2F;mo, again, assuming list price and discarding when security updates are over.<p>I&#x27;m currently typing from my Moto G6, which came out in April 2018. I bought in July of that year for $100 (it was a BOGO with a buddy&#x27;s $400 Moto One Zoom, they were literally giving them away as a backup to promote their more expensive phone because the BOM cost was so cheap). I plug it in on my desk at work because the battery sucks now, but that&#x27;s no great hardship. By that math, I&#x27;ve enjoyed the use of a smartphone for $1.62 per month (would be $3.25 at list). Yes, it&#x27;s only running Android 9 and not getting &quot;security updates&quot; anymore, but I have my phone app, messaging app, a camera, and Firefox, and that&#x27;s about all I need.<p>I think it would be ridiculous to spend $30 or $40 A MONTH for a smartphone. It doesn&#x27;t matter what some people pay for a fantasy football team app, that has nothing to do with buying hardware.
