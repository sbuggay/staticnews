I totally believe that. Lots of things gradually become harder as you grow older, and language doesn&#x27;t seem particularly different in that regard. The question is whether that&#x27;s because your body &quot;cements phonemes in place&quot; around age 12, or whether there&#x27;s something else at play that&#x27;s likely gradual and not such a sharp boundary. The fact that it&#x27;s rare might be just due to the (a) effort required to learn something new being higher <i>in general</i>, or the (b) perceived RoI being lower, or a ton of other factors that don&#x27;t boil down to &quot;your phonemes are cemented in place&quot;... right? Anecdotally I know in at least one particular case that I observed and inquired about, that person (who&#x27;s also very smart and hard-working in general) told me they made a very deliberate effort over a handful of years to improve their accent after immigrating, and that&#x27;s how they sounded like a native now. I totally believe that many people are just unwilling to invest the effort required (which certainly increases with age). I&#x27;m just finding it hard to believe there&#x27;s some biological force preventing you from doing it past age 12, given I&#x27;ve seen otherwise.<p>&gt; it&#x27;s more about the brain&#x27;s ability to hear sounds (my wife can&#x27;t hear the difference between a number of sounds despite having lived in my country for many years and speaking the language well).<p>That might be true for <i>some</i> sounds for <i>some</i> people, but I also have a hard time believing it&#x27;s such a general thing to the extent you&#x27;re painting it here. It seems more likely to me the explanation is something else, like maybe nobody has managed to give her a good enough explanation as to how they&#x27;re different sounds. (Maybe not the best example, but I had a hard time distinguishing ch and s in German until someone explained to me how they&#x27;re each pronounced.

And believe me, it&#x27;s not about putting in the effort. But to distinguish certain sounds my wife has to watch my lips - this is particularly noticeable if I dictate and she writes.  As for training - she received two years of training (30 hours a week) with expert teachers who knew a lot of tricks for how to hear and (not the least) pronounce sounds. Tricks that I didn&#x27;t know about.<p>But I&#x27;ve also seen this with American and some English adults trying to learn Norwegian - a great many of them can&#x27;t hear the difference between vowels which, to me, are totally different.

Kittens not allowed to see horizontal lines for the first few months would never be able to see horizontal lines, ever.<p>It&#x27;s at least somewhat like that with humans too. Ever wondered why some kids are wearing a patch over one eye?  If the child needs glasses but (in particular) when they didn&#x27;t get proper correction early on then they may have double vision, and what the brain does is to block one eye. That eye, despite &quot;seeing&quot;, will lose the paths in the brain necessary for seeing well. The patch forces the brain to start using the eye again.<p>This happened to me - the doctor told my father &quot;no need to check this regularly&quot;, and after some years one of my eyes had indeed lost resolution. It&#x27;s still like that. One eye can see very well, the other at much lower resolution. Though I found that even at middle age it was possible to improve that to some extent - not the actual resolution, but the brain&#x27;s ability to actively use the eye could be improved a little. I would read books with only one eye. Could only read half a page at the beginning.

The sound processing is not hooked up to cognition in the way it would be in a brain that had always had sensory input from the ears.

Our understanding of language acquisition comes from Feral Children[1], who had no language understanding at all, but could hear. Aissam has language skills, though developed late - The article mentions he started learning Spanish Sign Language at 8 years old. That&#x27;s already a remarkable feat.

Is there any &#x27;broad spectrum&#x27; type gene therapy currently in the pipeline of any company out there? (not specific to audiology)<p>And is the narrow scope because it is easy to control in these early days or is that we simple don&#x27;t know enough to make more complex gene therapeutics without understanding collateral damage, side-effects, for example?</div><br/><div id="39115127" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39115127" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kozinc</span><span>|</span><a href="#39114784">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39110941">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39115127">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39115127">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Being a layman too, as I understand it, it&#x27;s because the deafness is caused by a single (mutated) gene which makes it (comparatively) easy to change. In this case, because the altered gene causes a necessary protein to be faulty or missing, gene transfer therapy can introduce a normal copy of the gene to recover the function of the protein.<p>For other diseases caused like this you&#x27;re mostly right on the money - sometimes because while a single gene might be the culprit, the mechanism is unknown, sometimes mutations in some ‘single-gene disorders’ may not be in a single-gene at all, not to even mention other possible interactions or the risks inherent to gene therapy.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39110941" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39110941" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chewmieser</span><span>|</span><a href="#39114784">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39108710">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39110941">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39110941">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Gift article link: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2024&#x2F;01&#x2F;23&#x2F;health&#x2F;deaf-gene-therapy.html?unlocked_article_code=1.P00.uUmQ.55Z_m9iz-_Dg&amp;smid=url-share" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2024&#x2F;01&#x2F;23&#x2F;health&#x2F;deaf-gene-therapy....</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="39108710" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39108710" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">CommanderData</span><span>|</span><a href="#39110941">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39110657">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39108710">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39108710">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If true this is ground breaking news especially in the Audiology community.<p>There is zero treatment besides hearing aids &#x2F; cochlear implants for sensory hearing loss in Human history until now.</div><br/><div id="39111477" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39111477" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">starttoaster</span><span>|</span><a href="#39108710">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39110635">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39111477">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39111477">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is incredible news to me, as someone with horrible tinnitus, I&#x27;m choosing to take this to mean that some day we may even have a treatment.
