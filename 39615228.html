No, the point was adding a new storage class to programming languages.<p>I worked at Object Design, and we had (IMHO) an incredibly elegant approach. In our approach, persistence really was orthogonal to type, for C&#x2F;C++. If you want a FooBar, you would write &quot;new FooBar(123)&quot;. That gives you a FooBar in the heap, disappears at process end (or on deletion), etc. Or you could write &quot;new(db) FooBar(123)&quot;, and then on commit (we had transactions of course), the FooBar would be in the database, and accessible by other processes.<p>A page-faulting mechanism would bring in pages containing locations that your program referenced. That itself was very elegant.<p>But the really beautiful thing about this architecture was getting it to work in a 32-bit address space. We did some clever things about mapping portions of the address space during the faulting process to make things work transparently. (This problem pretty much disappears with a 64-bit address space.)<p>Separate from all that, we had a collection library, integrated with an OO query language. E.g., you could have a collections of widgets in your database, write &quot;widgets[: weight &lt; 0.01 and !strcmp(color, &#x27;red&#x27;) :], and get back a set containing the qualifying widgets. We also supported 1:1, 1:n, and m:n relationships, which would maintain pointers and sets of pointers in both directions.<p>It was a &quot;database system&quot; because our VCs wanted it to be. But it really wasn&#x27;t. It really was a new storage class for C&#x2F;C++, and later, for Smalltalk and Java.<p>Object Design also had a spectacularly talented group of engineers, many of whom came from MIT AI Lab&#x2F;Symbolics.</div><br/><div id="39649703" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39649703" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jdougan</span><span>|</span><a href="#39646938">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39649157">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39649703">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39649703">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">How would you compare it to Gemstone&#x2F;S?

For instance, considering the case of schema changes, unless the system bundles its language inside the database, for performance sake, to perform such changes in an &quot;Orthogonal Persistence&quot; system external to the database would take an completely disproportionate amount of time relative to using SQL in the database. The data runtime I work with uses the idea of lenses (where valid lenses would necessarily be reversible) to allow for coherent, undoable schema changes, but I still resort to SQL for regular (eager) migrations (the lenses system for schema changes can still be useful for migrations applied lazily).</div><br/><div id="39646601" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39646601" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jerf</span><span>|</span><a href="#39644548">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39646943">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39646601">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39646601">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Or, to put it another like, like visual programming, like &quot;programming languages should be able to wear syntaxes like themes&quot;, like &quot;there ought to be some sort of nocode type solution with all the power of conventional programming but easy enough for anyone to pick up&quot;, there are <i>reasons</i> why this is not how all programming works already. Good ones and big ones. And none of those reasons are that nobody has had the idea before or put work into implementing it. If you want to succeed with an approach like this, you&#x27;re going to need to understand them.<p>To be honest, such experience as I&#x27;ve had with automated persistence has generally actually <i>strongly</i> convinced me of the opposite, that it is a <i>positive good</i> that we do not get persistence everywhere. Consider the understanding that we get from functional programming that state is generally dangerous and to be carefully managed. Pervasive persistence fights <i>hard</i> against that careful management. Now state is not just in your program up until the OS process is terminated, but it&#x27;s <i>all</i> permanently and automatically persisted. You get a <i>huge</i> new class of bugs involving path dependence on what bits of code were running across what bits of state when, and who ran which versions, and you hit them <i>all the time</i>, and they are <i>nightmares</i> to debug. At least when the program has the courtesy to completely cease existing and leave some particular concrete bit of state behind for the future, and then run through your code to load it back from that location, you have boundaries, and procedures for minimization and reconstruction. I actually shy away from too much automated persistence, and also have a very skeptical eye on the ever-present promise of memory that is as fast as RAM but persists like SSDs... I rather expect the computing world will discover that &quot;rebooting&quot; is not just a crutch, but actually a pretty fundamental and useful tool. However much in <i>theory</i> your software should never need it, in practice it&#x27;s just too useful.<p>That said, best of luck to those jousting with this windmill. I&#x27;m not saying don&#x27;t joust, people in general probably don&#x27;t joust enough, I&#x27;m just saying, learn the history of why this hasn&#x27;t worked before and learn the challenges.

Transactions don’t compose in that way.<p>You would basically have to “color” every function based on wether it may perform a transaction or not, and within a transaction block you would only be allowed to call functions that don’t themselves perform a transaction.

Back when people routinely turned their machines &quot;off and on again&quot;, it became part of that convention. But now uptime can be measured in years, and even personal laptops can enter and exit suspended state for weeks on end without clearing volatile memory.<p>What we have developed in <i>software</i> systems to accommodate this on long running processes is garbage collection.<p>If the volatile&#x2F;non-volatile distinction had never developed, all that would have happened is that R&amp;D into garbage collection would have been more intense, and earlier.<p>In fact Lisp had garbage collection from day 1.<p>Systems like Smalltalk were also built from the ground up on  an image-based model where all reachable state was persistent.<p>In other words: transient data does not necessitate volatile memory. It necessitates garbage collection, though. (And likely also a distinction in programming between &quot;performant&quot; memory areas and non-performant, assuming our NV storage is the latter.)<p>In a way, programmers having to deal with their garbage upfront and not relying on <i>&quot;have you tried turning it off and on again?&quot;</i> could have created better software engineering practices earlier?
