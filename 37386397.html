The difference is: guns aren&#x27;t common, and certainly aren&#x27;t often carried, and most definitely not openly (apart from farmers and hunters, but the gun must be unloaded and broken(.
My fave is talking to Americans that &#x27;can&#x27;t wait to get back home so I can carry my gun, for protection, it&#x27;s my right&#x27;. Not a single one of them has been threatened whilst here. Nor have they been threatened in the States....but it&#x27;s their right to protect themselves from the government.

You could pass the background check and then decide you don&#x27;t want the gun after all.<p>You may be referring to a Form 4473 -- the DRoS (Dealer Record of Sale) -- which does record which person received which gun (with serial number) -- and all licensed dealers maintain these records, for all guns they sell (not just handguns). These records form a sort of a search tree, since the manufacturer records which wholesaler the serial number went to the, the wholesaler records the retailer and the retailer records the end user. These records are useful in regulating the traffic in arms; but the decentralized nature of them means that the government can not go on fishing expeditions -- can not just go out and query the database and see what looks interesting today.<p>Here&#x27;s how the DRoS are used in regulating the arms trade. Say police come across a big box of guns from Colt. They can go to Colt with a suitable warrant and say, hey, where did these go to? And then go to the wholesaler, on down the tree.

This turns out to be dangerous in practice because people can think the pistol is on safe when it isn&#x27;t; or think it is ready to fire when they need it to and, lo and behold, it&#x27;s not. It turns out to be safer in practice to just assume the gun is shootable when it&#x27;s out of the holster -- and if that&#x27;s not safe enough for the situation you&#x27;re in, put it back in the holster!<p>Glocks have a system that is systems called &quot;safe action&quot; where there is a system of internal locks that prevents the weapon from firing in situations where the gun is dropped, hit by a car, struck from the side, &amp;c -- this is not really what most people are thinking of when they think of a safety.

What country in EU ?
Because for example here in CZ, there&#x27;s a lot of firearms. But guess what, you must pay for a gun license and have a doctor examination with possibility of psych. evaluation, then a gun license exam is really hard also practice test of gun handling and shooting is pretty hard and not cheap.<p>So you will think twice to get it and you really don&#x27;t want to loose it.
Basically turning gun owners into the most law abiding citizens there is.<p>If you&#x27;re talking about countries like UK or similar, where you can&#x27;t legally defend against attackers and biggest cities are controlled by gangs with kitchen knives and acid bottles. Even police don&#x27;t have guns and can&#x27;t arrest them, cuz racism or something.

Your source uses ages 0-19 as &quot;children and adolescents.&quot;  Guess what happens when you lump in those extra two years of 18-year-olds and 19-year-olds, who are legal adults?<p>You also lump in a disproportionate amount of street gang-related shootings, which have different causes and different solutions, and make it look like suburban teens are uniquely at risk from firearms . . . when they&#x27;re not.  The vast majority of firearm homicides in this country are suicides, and the next-most involve street gangs and the drug trade, and involve young men with criminal records killing other young men with criminal records using illegally-obtained pistols.</div><br/><div id="37388534" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37388534" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">picture</span><span>|</span><a href="#37386980">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37388342">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37387697">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37388534">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37388534">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Do street gangs wait until you&#x27;re 18?

EG, why have anyone, who isn&#x27;t paying, even connected?<p>Then I remembered something.<p>I lived in a house, where there was a shared box for 2 units.  Someone had pried open the box, and removed the filters.  As a result, the cable guy disconnected the wire at the pole.<p>This resulted in something different.  Instead of a cutoff, most channels came through, just very fuzzy.  And as a kid, I lived in a rural area, and we owned an antenna booster&#x2F;amp, which had made signals poorer than this, crystal clear.<p>It seemed that leaving an uncapped end inside a box on the pole, with loads of signal, bled enough for a usable signal to get through.<p>So this is probably why a filter was placed.
