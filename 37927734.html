they don&#x27;t even know what&#x27;s going on with prominently (heh) observable phenomena on the surface of the sun or how to stabilize a tokamak.  but to be conservative let&#x27;s consider just the 4°–4000° temperature range where we have solids and liquids<p>from that temperature range, covering three orders of magnitude, carbon-chain molecules have interesting and complex behavior over the range 200°–500°, more or less.  just a factor of 2.5.  13% of the temperature range.  below 200° (-73°C) pretty much all organic chemicals crystallize and become brittle and nonliving, though there are a few boring exceptions like methane.  above 500° (230°C) they are unstable, breaking apart into elemental carbon and methane, again with a very few exceptions like teflon.  the temperature range over which carbon chains are practical to synthesize is smaller still<p>a chemist on titan (94° absolute) would consider implausible the suggestion that living cells could be made out of carbon-chain molecules dissolved in water, a material that doesn&#x27;t even melt until hellish temperatures nearly three times the boiling point of methane.  a chemist on venus (740° absolute) would consider implausible the suggestion that living cells could be made out of such absurdly unstable molecules as carbon-chain polymers — much less with amide groups, which she knows as violently reactive with ordinary everyday substances like red-hot sulfuric acid.  moreover, she would consider the pressure on earth&#x27;s surface (1% of atmospheric for a venusian) to be a good approximation to the vacuum of space, constantly exposed to sterilizing levels of ultraviolet from the sun<p>(venus and titan specifically are not covered in vegetation or presumably in chemists, but there are astronomical numbers of other planets with conditions like theirs, and as sagan&#x27;s paper pointed out, antarctica isn&#x27;t exactly a jungle either)<p>there are interesting things going on over the other 87% of the temperature range, too.  at room temperature the humans mostly know phosphates as minerals that are unusually hard to melt, but phosphoric acid just starts to polymerize above about 500° absolute and stays liquid past 1000°, polymerizing more and more enthusiastically; some common phosphates remain solid past 2000°.  neat silica becomes a useful solvent at temperatures a bit higher than that, and silicates of sodium or potassium can be liquid down to room temperature if plasticized with enough water; silica is nearly as abundant as carbon.  ammonia is liquid from 195° to 240°, a narrower range than water (273° to 373°, which is a 3:4 ratio to ammonia&#x27;s 4:5) but not ridiculously so, and shares many of water&#x27;s interesting properties, and we already know many interesting substances that can be synthesized in an ammonia solution, including many that are not stable at room temperature (and therefore might be in a useful reactivity range in ammonia&#x27;s liquid range).  and there are 1.7 orders of magnitude of temperature below ammonia&#x27;s freezing point before you get to liquid helium and the cosmic background radiation.  most of the universe&#x27;s volume is in that temperature range, though not most of its matter, and if dyson&#x27;s &#x27;future of life in an ever-expanding universe&#x27; is correct, those temperatures and below are where our descendants will spend the vast majority of history<p>but the humans really only know a tiny fraction of the possible complex molecules at those temperatures, because working with them in their laboratories is difficult, expensive, dangerous, and unprofitable; molecules that explode when you heat them up to room temperature, or solidify into refractory ceramics when cooled anywhere near it, will not yield useful drugs, elastomers, cheap injection-molding plastics, or fuels, so research into them has mostly been pure, not applied.  the exceptions are mostly high-temperature ceramics research focused on finding the strongest and most refractory materials, not interesting synthesis pathways that can operate inside white-hot zirconia crucibles<p>but don&#x27;t let the utterly disorderly behavior of, say, nitrogen chains at the melting point of water fool you into thinking their chemistry is trivial; most compounds that are stable at 10% of that temperature haven&#x27;t been discovered yet<p>(by the humans)</div><br/><div id="37936856" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37936856" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jacquesm</span><span>|</span><a href="#37929606">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37935484">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37939821">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37936856">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37936856">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I love this post.

(2) It can form double- and triple-bonds readily.
(3) It bonds strongly to itself in a configuration that allows it to form long chains.<p>(1) is satisfied by other elements in its column on the periodic table, but silicon (the next element down in its group) and the following members (germanium, tin, and lead) fail (2) and increasingly (3). Silicon will form chains, but is reluctant to form double bonds; in general, double bonds become weaker for atoms further down the table. Silicon (and silicone, chains of Si-O bonds) are the most promising analogs but they have a lot of problems.<p>(2) is satisfied by most other light nonmetals, but those nonmetals mostly fail (3) and almost all fail (1).<p>The highly-electronegative oxygen doesn&#x27;t really want to bond with itself (failing 3) and almost always takes a -2 oxidation state (failing 1).<p>Nitrogen actually does form four-bond atoms decently often (most notably the ammonium ion), so it somewhat satisfies (1) to some extent, but is so eager to form N2 that most polynitrogen compounds are wildly unstable to the point that &quot;nitro&quot; is a term even laypeople know is associated with explosives (failing 3).<p>Boron can form three bonds, allowing some of the complexity of (1), and will form nice polyboron compounds (3), but doesn&#x27;t like forming double bonds (failing 2), and the bonds in boranes are so weak that they&#x27;re mostly quite reactive (weakening 3).<p>Sulfur will form polysulfur chains (the most common form is an eight-membered ring), but sulfur (like its cousin oxygen) usually doesn&#x27;t form more than two bonds except with extremely electronegative partners (like its effective total bond order of 3 in sulfur dioxide or 4 in sulfur trioxide).<p>------<p>There&#x27;s another problem here too: life is likely to form out of <i>common</i> elements in its environment, and carbon is just WAY more common than the alternatives. The mechanisms by which the elements are formed in stars very strongly favors elements with even atomic numbers (because they are mostly formed from helium-4 nuclei) and the burning processes peak at carbon&#x2F;oxygen, neon, magnesium, and silicon.<p>As a result, carbon is very common. It&#x27;s the fourth most common element in the Universe (after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen), and ~an order of magnitude more common than any of the elements discussed above except oxygen (which has basically no analogs to carbon chemistry).</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37936627" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37936627" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tremon</span><span>|</span><a href="#37929606">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37934854">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37935067">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37930229">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37936627">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37936627">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As I understood it, it would be perfectly possible to replicate most of the functionality of life (amino acids) by moving down one period in the periodic table. So that would be C-&gt;Si, N-&gt;P, P-&gt;As, etc (with or without O-&gt;S substitution [0]). You can&#x27;t do the same by moving left or right in the periodic table because elements are grouped vertically by their electrochemical properties (electrovalence), so moving left or right gives you a material with wildly different properties.<p>The problem is that all of the molecules in period 3 are much more massive than their carbon-family counterparts, which means that the energy required to construct said building blocks must be equally higher. If we assume a high-entropy environment exists for these molecules to form, the first obvious question is then: how come carbon-based life didn&#x27;t appear in that environment as well and outcompeted Si-based life? Would it have to be high-pressure environments like inside gas giant planets, or high-temperature environments on planets much closer to the star? And if the environment is inhospitable to carbon-based life, is there sufficient stability in that environment to produce more than just the functional building blocks of life?<p>Next, the question of development speed is an interesting one. Of course, evolution isn&#x27;t linear so everything here is conjecture, but just as a thought experiment: How long would it take for such an environment (inhospitable to carbon-based life, but capable of spawning silicon-based life) to produce single-celled organisms, and then for those organisms to meaningfully alter their biosphere (like Earth&#x27;s Great Oxidation Event) so that we can detect those changes through our telescopes? Earth is 4.5 billion years old; oxygen started appearing in the atmosphere 2 billion years ago, but didn&#x27;t appear in meaningful quantities until less than 1 billion years ago. That 3.5 billion years from planet formation to detectable biosphere signature for carbon-based life (n=1, of course). If we take a wild guess that silicon-based life is slower to develop by a factor 2, we&#x27;d have to find planets that are at least 7 billion years old (and have been stable for that time). Given that the lower bound for the age of the entire universe is 8 billion years, we&#x27;re getting close to planets that are as old as the universe itself. Add to that that our telescopes are also looking into the past, the further out we look -- but 100 million years (the Virgo supercluster) seems negligible compared to the supposed 7 billion years projected incubation time:  It seems rather optimistic to expect silicon-based life signatures to readily appear on our telescopes.<p>[0] and then there&#x27;s also <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hypothetical_types_of_biochemistry#Non-water_solvents" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hypothetical_types_of_biochemi...</a> -- where they suggest NH3 and its ionized counterparts could serve as a replacement for H2O, OH- and H3O+</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37930229" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37930229" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Beijinger</span><span>|</span><a href="#37929606">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37934854">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37930487">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37930229">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37930229">[24 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&quot;Life in other places might be radically different from our own, and we might be looking for the wrong things&quot;<p>Very possible.

Of course we know a few hundred million light years are needed before there was life at all on earth, but could you detect it?  Does intelligent life help or not (the first radio transmission was in the 1880s, so 140 light years - but could you detect those transmissions that far out)?</div><br/><div id="37931634" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37931634" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kjkjadksj</span><span>|</span><a href="#37931471">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37934420">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37931634">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37931634">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I would think that a truly advanced civilization wouldn’t even need to leave their system to find life in the universe.

They could look at Earth compared to the Sun and other planets in the system and see Earth has a bunch of biosignatures that would be broken down by the Sun&#x27;s UV radiation if not constantly regenerated.<p>One or two markers would be inconclusive but a bunch of different ones would give a high probability of life existing here. It&#x27;s why the &quot;Dark Forest&quot; concept is fundamentally silly. There&#x27;s no hiding Earth&#x27;s biosignatures.<p>If the arbitrarily advanced aliens have a long enough measurement baseline and are within 150 or so light years they could also see the technosignatures of the Industrial Revolution with different air pollutants. If they&#x27;re within about 60-70 light years they&#x27;d start seeing evidence of radioactive isotopes from above ground nuclear testing.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37931621" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37931621" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tempodox</span><span>|</span><a href="#37930024">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37929615">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37931621">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37931621">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As already mentioned in the movie Mars Attacks, the more interesting question is whether there is <i>intelligent</i> life on Earth.</div><br/><div id="37933450" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37933450" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">streakfix</span><span>|</span><a href="#37931621">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37931643">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37933450">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37933450">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Very unlikely</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37929615" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37929615" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tantalor</span><span>|</span><a href="#37931621">prev</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37929615">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37929615">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; To use our own home to test... was an extraordinary suggestion at the time<p>Was it?
