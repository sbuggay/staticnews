If your threat model includes global adversaries, you have can&#x27;t rely on TLS because governments can trivially compromise TLS providers and TLS exposes users to the lowest common denominator TLS. The lowest common denominator TLS (ACME DNS-1) and the mitigation to the TLS provider problem (CAA records) are both based on DNS.<p>So you either accept that TLS is the global maxima for security and world governments can basically permanently compromise the internet, or you build private PKI systems, or you want something like DNSSec.

I expect it to be quite rare, because it&#x27;s an elaborate attack with a weak payoff.<p>The right way to think about this CA issue is this:<p>* The largest, best-funded, savviest security teams in tech are, like the rest of tech, not signing their domains; the major TLDs are overwhelmingly not signed (there is low single digit uptake in .COM for instance, and what&#x27;s there is overwhelmingly not big companies but rather random domains signed by registrars that auto-sign). Nobody who&#x27;s actually targeted for CA misissuance attacks uses DNSSEC to mitigate that threat.<p>* The WebPKI already has a system in place to guard against misissuance that, unlike DNSSEC, actually does work: Certificate Transparency.

Which I do.<p>With DNSSEC, I know that anyone asking for IP addresses of my web server will get the correct address, and in the future it may be possible to use TLSA records (and&#x2F;or HTTPS records) so that the user’s web browser can be certain that it is connecting to the correct site, with the correct key.  The only weak point is that the user might be using a DNS resolver which may be correctly checking the DNSSEC signatures, but the DNS replies, sent from the resolver to the user, are not signed, only “authenticated” by the AD bit.  (This is where DoT ­– or even, blech, DoH – might actually help.)  Or the user could run their own local resolver with no untrusted path between their device and their resolver, closing the gap completely.<p>Contrast that with using no DNSSEC, only DoH (or DoT).  The user asks the resolver for the IP address (and possibly HTTPS&#x2F;TLSA records), and the resolver asks the authoriative DNS server for the information. But the whole conversation between the resolver and the authoritative DNS server is completely unsigned, and can be manipulated at will by any middlemen.  Also, it is not even TCP (which is hard, but not impossible) to manipulate as a man-in-the-middle, but DNS is most often <i>UDP</i>.  But let’s say there is no manipulation here.  How do you trust the identity of the resolver?  Because they have a nice certificate from “Honest Achmed&#x27;s Used Cars and Certificates”¹, which says they they are indeed the DoH resolver the user has configured?

The argument was however that physical stores did not need to have similar protection, and that the issue really was with the weak security of credit cards. HTTPS was a unstable solution for a problem which people argued should had been solved with the credit card system. Physical security devices was again lifted as the future solutions to this problem.<p>It should also be mentioned here that credit card numbers as a security token has actually slowly been phased out in favor of other forms of payment systems online, and many banks today implement additional security requirement if you pay with a credit card. Black market with stolen CC numbers, despite https use by web stores, used to be one of the biggest issues with the internet, so even with all the stores using https it wasn&#x27;t a solution to that problem.<p>I remember people talking about performance issues with https until the early 2010. &quot;Every single micro second slower means reduced sales&quot; was something people was very concerned about.
