Efficiency of turbines smaller than grid scale is simply not anywhere close to what piston engines can do at e.g. car size. Even at naval scale, turbines only win in use cases where power density is more important than fuel efficiency. Helicopters are deep in the (specific) camp of power density beats efficiency because carrying a heavier but more efficient engine would easily eat the fuel savings. Fixed wing aircraft gain range by climbing high, but up there both efficiency and power density of piston engines decreases dramatically with decreasing air density, so they are also in the camp of power density over efficiency (turbines are also affected, but not quite as much).<p>Note that despite all this, the Otto Aviation 500L that is all about fuel efficiency at high altitudes uses a piston engine (they probably put a lot of effort into their turbocharger, those can lessen the impact of thin air)</div><br/><div id="37783219" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37783219" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">anjel</span><span>|</span><a href="#37781145">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37782070">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37787795">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37783219">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37783219">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Celebrity and Cunard built a few Cruise ships that use turbines to generate power to its electric motor propulsion.[1] They regret the endeavor owing to cost of operation.[2]<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ge.com&#x2F;gas-power&#x2F;industries&#x2F;cruise-lines" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ge.com&#x2F;gas-power&#x2F;industries&#x2F;cruise-lines</a><p>[2]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.airliners.net&#x2F;forum&#x2F;viewtopic.php?t=1202425" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.airliners.net&#x2F;forum&#x2F;viewtopic.php?t=1202425</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="37787795" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37787795" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jabl</span><span>|</span><a href="#37781145">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37782070">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37783219">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37785222">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37787795">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37787795">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Another reason many navies like turbines is that big diesels produce a lot of low frequency noise which travels very far underwater, so submarines can hear you coming from a very long distance.<p>Although many navies do operate combinations of diesels and gas turbines (CODAG etc.), in such cases the diesels need to be installed on special shock absorbing mountings, in some cases even with a diesel-electric drive to avoid coupling the vibrations of the engine to the hull via the propeller shaft.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37785222" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37785222" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">KennyBlanken</span><span>|</span><a href="#37781145">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37782070">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37787795">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37788218">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37785222">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37785222">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The bit about the naval use and efficiency isn&#x27;t quite accurate.<p>The issue isn&#x27;t that they&#x27;re not efficient.

Many people could drive safely without speed limits, but we have speed limits to cater for people who can’t. My point is that if this type of modification truly is legal in America, that’s scary, and Australia got the laws right.
