Mathematics is not &quot;easy&quot;, it is a niche; some people are good at, some are average, some are bad.
Expecting every person to be able to do math is folly. People will fail. People already fail at memorizing math concepts and literally just applying said concept by plugging the numbers around.
Some people just don&#x27;t &quot;get&quot; it, I know I don&#x27;t &quot;get&quot; probability, but is pretty  good at other branches of math like group theory and calculus.
To some people, deriving derivatives is basically black magic, but to me it&#x27;s pretty intuitive.<p>Thus, if the world economy relies on people being good at probability then I am screwed.
Fortunately for me, the world economy somehow relies on people being good at writing texts on a computer to tell it what to do (programming).
I personally think programming is piss easy (its the actual problem being solved that is hard, programming is just knowing how to knock a hammer)
However, there are people out there that simply can&#x27;t program, either because they are not interested or not capable.
Perhaps they are good at something else that is not entirely marketable?

I often found that they had some practical algorithm memorized step-by-step and some graphical or conceptual intuition, but when the steps and intuition betrayed them we’d end up spending a while backtracking to find where they lost track of the concrete rules, and then we could work our way forward to catch up to their intuition. Practical results are good guideposts but don’t replace full understanding I think.<p>That’s just my perspective, though, I have a pretty simplistic, algebraic way of looking at math. I could never be a mathematician or see true beauty in math, it is just a bunch of little rules to me.<p>IMO calculus class is fundamentally just relatively abstract compared to the stuff before it. But once you’ve finished it, your engineering and science classes should be full of practical, reinforcing applications, right?</div><br/><div id="36690969" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36690969" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rocqua</span><span>|</span><a href="#36689810">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36690193">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36689971">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36690969">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36690969">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Isn&#x27;t the actual calculations of e.g. integrals the least useful part of calculus for non-stem students?

At my high school, and it seems many others, the honors kids were put on the track leading to calculus while everyone else ended up in a dedicated statistics class. The honors kids were expected to pick up statistics through supplementary assignments in their laboratory science classes, and this same approach carried over into lower-division undergrad. As an adult, I feel like that approach has only given me cause to go back and seek out a firmer grounding in statistics.</div><br/><div id="36690159" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36690159" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sanderjd</span><span>|</span><a href="#36690105">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36691035">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36690159">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36690159">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Motivating topics for students is so important and underrated.

Others don&#x27;t have any interest in that, but rather would be motivated by the beauty of pure math.

Grinding through „hard things“ can leave you with a great deal of confusion. It is so much easier to do „hard things“ if you love doing them. 
The problem with math is: it is very hard to learn later on in life. Maybe even as hard as drawing.
