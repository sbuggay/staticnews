If I can do job of 5 other people, I can be compensated like two others and the company is still ahead. Or if that&#x27;s just my arrogance talking, there can be an objective system to measure work accomplished and set rewards accordingly. Instead all of my questions about advancement are met with demands for me to write PRDs and nag people who refuse to do work to do it, but without me actually having authority to make them.<p>I finally decided to just not sweat over it, do work that matches my pay in 2-3 days a week and spend the rest of my time teaching better programming skills to whoever is willing to learn and has a good attitude about it. With focus on general skills that they can take to their next job rather than internal proprietary tech.

This great essay analyzing The Office argues that in a modern business context you&#x27;re one of the three. [1]<p>Those &quot;functional elites&quot; you mentioned? Usually they&#x27;re working 20-50% more for 0-25% percent more pay. They&#x27;re called the clueless because they&#x27;ve been conned into working more for less, usually under some clever guise like company being family or company values or the promise of a promotion that&#x27;s always a cycle or two away. The essay then goes on to argue that losers are really just the clueless once they &quot;get it.&quot; Losers understand the treadmill and lean into the tedium always aiming to save their time by playing dumb as needed. Sociopaths break out of the cycle by operating only with concern for power and switching up how they talk to folks based on whether they&#x27;re clueless, losers or fellow sociopaths.<p>Sociopaths speak in powertalk -- an exchange of information on clear terms. It&#x27;s usually veiled because the clueless and losers listen in and it makes them feel uncomfortable. If it weren&#x27;t veiled it would probably sound like lawyer-jargon with lots of plausible deniability, conditions, arguing and explicit shared definitions.<p>Losers and clueless speak in their own languages based on who they&#x27;re talking with. It&#x27;s basically just lots of trying to feel okay... except for when it comes to losers speaking with sociopaths. There the only communication is straight talk, which is basically just direct requests of a master-slave dynamic (i.e. &quot;do this&quot;).

Sure, as a manager you should try your very best to shield the team from crap work and have a healthy balance, understand their interests and find opportunities that match (even outside your team), but ultimately also work is work and is not always, or even often, possible to have super exciting bleeding edge work that fits everyone&#x27;s interests.

I was an effective IC, so people couldn&#x27;t complain. Don&#x27;t see any reason that wouldn&#x27;t hold true for the ICs that I work with, now that I&#x27;m a manager.<p>&gt; I mean, delegation and ownership are fine as a mechanism to boost engagement and career growth, but you can&#x27;t delegate everything (otherwise what are you doing again?). Also, what&#x27;s up with the &quot;if they think&quot; wording here.

At least in engineering, if you think you&#x27;re going to make the decisions just because &quot;you&#x27;re the manager&quot;, then I think you&#x27;re managing backwards. If I need to make a decision, I&#x27;m in charge of convincing people it&#x27;s the right decision. But I also have to listen to those people when they tell me their concerns, and change course if their concerns are reasonable.<p>It sounds to me, if you&#x27;re a manager, that you&#x27;re only an effective manager for people who are already succesful. I think the thing that makes someone a good manager, is that they can make anyone effective.

Often you depend on the number of people who trust you from their experience working with you that have switched companies <i>and</i> have come into a trusted position there.<p>My career:<p>ages 20-30: Individual contributor.<p>ages 30-45: (Engineering) manager, running product development teams of varying sizes (up to about 50 people), being all over the architecture&#x2F;system design. Not really coding in a focused way.<p>ages 45-now: Individual contributor, coding most of the time.<p>I was really concerned I wouldn&#x27;t be able to keep the interest in actual coding all day long when I went back to that, but lo and behold, I&#x27;m actually finding it more fun and rewarding than the management roles. Stress is down too.<p>You too can recover from being a manager :).</div><br/><div id="36934455" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36934455" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jareklupinski</span><span>|</span><a href="#36934369">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36935127">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36934455">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36934455">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">thinking about making a move towards management, for a similar reason: I really enjoy programming, but after slinging code for 8 hours at work, I can&#x27;t justify working on my hobby projects when I come home anymore...<p>hoping that by using more of my &quot;soft skills&quot; and thinking about architecture at work, I&#x27;ll be able to come home and work something like a solitaire solver without feeling like it&#x27;s &quot;non-productive&quot;</div><br/><div id="36935382" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36935382" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">frabcus</span><span>|</span><a href="#36934369">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36934455">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36938848">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36935382">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36935382">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think over the years it&#x27;s healthy to switch back and forth between management and IC, and sometimes inbetween as a tech-lead manager.<p>Being recently hands on with the technology helps coach and assess reports and means you know the real situation of the software.<p>Being a manager, if you carve out enough space, lets you make a highly productive, happy, successful team, and sometimes you might be the best person to do that.<p>I think I&#x27;d find only doing one forever more a bit tiring!</div><br/></div></div><div id="36938848" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36938848" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pillefitz</span><span>|</span><a href="#36934369">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36934455">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36935382">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36934549">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36938848">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36938848">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Funny, I thought the same before switching to a product role.
