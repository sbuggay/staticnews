This pattern is as follows:
    &gt; 
    &gt; All languages contain terms for black and white.
    &gt; If a language contains three terms, then it contains a term for red.
    &gt; If a language contains four terms, then it contains a term for either green or yellow (but not both).
    &gt; If a language contains five terms, then it contains terms for both green and yellow.
    &gt; If a language contains six terms, then it contains a term for blue.
    &gt; If a language contains seven terms, then it contains a term for brown.
    &gt; If a language contains eight or more terms, then it contains terms for purple, pink, orange or gray.

Some dimension of their inner life will doubtlessly escape us.<p>However even with the ancients, we can in most cases understand why they did what they did.

Wrong! There is no word for “mind” in the Iliad, except maybe in the very newest interpolations. The words are things like kardia, noos, phrenes, and thumos, which Jaynes translates as heart, vision&#x2F;perception, belly, and sympathetic nervous system, respectively. He might translate the sentence about Agamemnon to say something like “Quivering rose in Agamemnon’s belly”. It still means the same thing – Agamemnon is afraid – but it’s how you would talk about it if you didn’t have an idea of “the mind” as the place where mental things happened – you would just notice your belly was quivering more. Later, when the Greeks got theory of mind, they repurposed all these terms. You can still find signs of this today, like how we say “I believe it in my heart”.<p>Of course it&#x27;s possible that Jaynes is simply wrong, and the Greeks <i>did</i> have a concept of the mind, and a translation that talks about the mind is genuinely more faithful than one that does not.</div><br/><div id="35737935" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35737935" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">malloryerik</span><span>|</span><a href="#35736587">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35737258">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35737440">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35737935">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35737935">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A very quick reply. Yes, I&#x27;ve read Julian Jaynes also, and have thought like you are thinking now. However I&#x27;m not sure how one would translate <i>noos</i> -- head? thoughts? feelings? Consider also that French, for example, has no word for &quot;mind&quot; and yet translators clearly don&#x27;t shy from the word. Now this is different of course, if the point is that the Homeric Greeks didn&#x27;t have the same idea of consciousness, but I think that idea can come through without ridding oneself of words like &quot;mind.&quot; Maybe you&#x27;d prefer a word like &quot;perception,&quot; but that introduces another burst of unhelpful associations, not least of which is its scientific and precise-sounding tone? Finally, when I read Homer, it seems clear that many characters do have, shall we say, internal deliberations, and that Homer is clear about this. So I tend to feel that Jaynes&#x27; interpretations might be best seen as tentative and unfinished.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="35737440" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35737440" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">alex_young</span><span>|</span><a href="#35736587">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35737111">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35737440">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35737440">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Hmm.
