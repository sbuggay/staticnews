Meanwhile most towns and newer parts of smaller, less affluent cities, or even wealthier suburbs don’t even _have_ sidewalks.<p>I think it’s ultimately part of our philosophy toward the built environment that “Europe is built with screws, the US is built with nails”— we build something that gets the job done at the time it’s built, then never come back to it.

There are too few offices for the demand, so most space in the agency is dedicated to the waiting room. I’ve waited nearly a day one unlucky time. And there are different functions per line.

Chips are very fussy and require lots of patience and intellect to be useful to people, while the latter&#x27;s success is more rooted in the aesthetics, ergonomics, user needs of everyday families.  This isn&#x27;t saying they&#x27;re wrong, just a sloppy way to talk about it.<p>What they&#x27;re really saying is the path from CAD to CAM is shorter than ever, and more integrated.  It sounds pretty great.  It does make me curious about where the tooling cost outstretches the gap between family and factory owner.  Probably making lots of Temu-grade consumer goods, such as a disposable lawn mower, or a coffee maker that&#x27;s good for 6 months.  Which is of course horrific for long-term ecology.

Making parts was mostly mechanized decades ago. The article talks about 3D printing in metal, which is a nice technology but way too slow to be used to bang out consumer products.<p>Assembly is still tough to automate. If you want automated assembly, you usually have to design things so that the parts go into place with little or no fuss. Vertical assembly is common, where everything is placed with a straight-down move.  This goes way back, to the first cheap mass-produced clocks, where there&#x27;s a baseplate with pins sticking out of it, you just drop on the gears in the right order, and it all comes together.<p>They mention Bright Machines. Their site is heavy on the hype, weak on the machine specs.[1]
They sell some kind of robotic assembly cell. So do many other companies. Sony had a nice one thirty years ago for making the Walkman. It&#x27;s not clear what Bright brings to the party. More software integration, probably; they talk about that a lot.<p>There are some new results from MIT on assembly planning.[2] This is kind of cute. They start with a game-type physics model of the assembled item and figure out how to take it apart. That&#x27;s reversed into an assembly plan. Joint work from MIT, Texas A&amp;M, and Autodesk.<p>It&#x27;s surprising how much manual work is involved in assembling a mobile phone. It&#x27;s a high-volume product with a modest number of parts, the ideal case for automation. Many early US-made mobile phones were assembled automatically. They were stacks of boards that just had to be dropped onto alignment pins and pressed together. Newer phones have tiny flat cables and connectors all over the place.<p>Most automated assembly lines involve a huge amount of custom tooling. It&#x27;s not a few robots with standard tools.<p>The state of the art in robotic assembly is far worse that you&#x27;d think it would be. And that&#x27;s after half a century of work on the problem, all the way back to McCarthy in the 1960s.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brightmachines.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2023&#x2F;05&#x2F;BrightMachines_brochure.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brightmachines.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2023&#x2F;05&#x2F;Br...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.mit.edu&#x2F;2022&#x2F;automated-way-assemble-thousands-objects-1207" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.mit.edu&#x2F;2022&#x2F;automated-way-assemble-thousands-o...</a></div><br/><div id="37097027" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37097027" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throw9away6</span><span>|</span><a href="#37096517">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37096801">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37096538">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37097027">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37097027">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Most people don’t understand how fast tolerances can stack up during assembly and how complicated any step could be.
