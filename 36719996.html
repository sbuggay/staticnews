This could explain the &quot;unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences&quot;.<p>It may also help to guide us away from the &quot;why is there something rather than nothing&quot; problem.  If existence is total chaos, then we as humans could be limited to the hyperplane of our own observable patterns, which fools us into thinking there is some inherent order -- which there isn&#x27;t.  This leaves us with &quot;why is there chaos rather than nothing&quot;, so I doubt it&#x27;s of any help :)<p>Great ideas to ponder, but rather hard to reason about.<p>(Edit: To avoid thinking that I&#x27;m a crackpot, with &quot;capability of understanding&quot;, I am referring to the physical processes that lead to the existence and dynamics of neurons, not to the platonic world of ideas on top of that.  If someone could point out how unoriginal or nonsensical this idea is, it would save me from writing a blog post about it.)</div><br/><div id="36721046" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36721046" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">barrenko</span><span>|</span><a href="#36720672">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36720747">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36721046">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36721046">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It&#x27;s not chaos, it&#x27;s infinitely ordered order most would rather die than accept.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36720747" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36720747" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">barrkel</span><span>|</span><a href="#36720672">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36720773">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36720747">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36720747">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The article seems poorly written, or at least self-contradictory in a way that makes me uncertain what it means. The introduction talks about the intuitionism framing mathematics as a human construction, in opposition to an objective reality. But the subsequent paragraph talks about the truth of proofs themselves as being subjective.<p>It seems to me that these are two different claims. I think mathematics is a human construction and doesn&#x27;t have a real substance. Instead, mathematics is a system of assumptions and generative rules, and more generally a discipline around creating and operating such systems. But &quot;truth&quot; within a system of assumptions and generative rules is not subjective, it&#x27;s mechanically provable.<p>A possible confusion remains in what &quot;true&quot; means. Can something relating to an imaginary system can be true, or is it false because truth can only apply to objective reality? I think it&#x27;s trivially true. Gollum was a hobbit, within the system of Middle Earth. If it&#x27;s not true, then we need a different word for true that does mean this, because this is what most people mean when they use the word about all sorts of imaginary constructs, from institutions to cultural symbols.</div><br/><div id="36721103" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36721103" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">constantcrying</span><span>|</span><a href="#36720747">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36721118">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36721103">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36721103">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;mathematics is a system of assumptions and generative rules, and more generally a discipline around creating and operating such systems.<p>This is essentially the standard mathematical approach developed during the early last century. From a few basic axioms (which are not really justifiable) new statements are proven and structures are built up. All notions of truth and provability are relative to that system. In standard ZFC (those are the standard axioms) mathematics &quot;1+1=2&quot; is, like all other statements, a statement about sets. The statement is true by the definitions of 1,2, &quot;=&quot; and &quot;+&quot;. In an alternative system with different axioms or definitions the statement is false.<p>This is not the view of intuitionists though. For them the symbols 1,2 or + aren&#x27;t formalized objects (e.g. sets in this case). They are just symbols, which transfer some (hopefully) shared meaning to another person, who then (potentially with some addition arguments) might also accept the truth of that statement.<p>In the former the question of &quot;truth&quot; is fully formal there can be no &quot;interpretation&quot; in any meaningful sense. Intuitionism places mathematics fully inside the mind of the mathematician and &quot;truth&quot; can only be found there.<p>&gt;Can something relating to an imaginary system can be true, or is it false because truth can only apply to objective reality?<p>In formalized mathematics &quot;truth&quot; is fully formal. There can not be any &quot;external&quot; truth derived from it, as any such statement is non-sensical.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36721118" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36721118" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">practal</span><span>|</span><a href="#36720747">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36721103">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36720925">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36721118">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36721118">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;  I think mathematics is a human construction and doesn&#x27;t have a real substance.

The project was first started by L. E. J. Brouwer, who rejected formalism. It was then developed by his student Arend Heyting, who formalized it with the Heyting algebra, a restricted variant of Boolean algebra that lacks the double negation elimination (~~p =&gt; p) and law of the excluded middle (p OR ~p).<p>Pretty much all work in intuitionistic mathematics continues the work of Heyting.

For me, that&#x27;s our act of interpretation of our sensory perceptions. Sometimes this all goes wrong and we construct a flawed model that does not correspond perfectly to actual external reality, such as when we are deceived by optical illusions, stage magic or just hallucinate.

There is the abstract collection of all possible mathematical objects, statements, proofs, etc. There is the subset which is the actual body of knowledge we have explored. within those parameters potentially there are those mathematical objects, statements, etc that are consistent, and there are those that are not consistent. The latter probably aren&#x27;t mathematics in a strict sense, but there&#x27;s also the act of doing mathematics, and even if we are calculating nonsense or exploring ideas that don&#x27;t work out, it&#x27;s still mathematics in the sense of the act.<p>I prefer to think of mathematics in general as a language, we are constructing descriptions of relationships between concepts, and hopefully those descriptions turn out to be consistent ones. When a description is proved to be consistent, we say that it is true. I suppose that makes me an intuitionist perhaps?<p>Everything I said in the first paragraph above about mathematics also applies to descriptions in any language. There is the abstract set of all possible statements in English. There is the set of statements that have been made, or at least that exist in writing, recordings and people&#x27;s minds and therefore exist encoded physically. There are statements that are grammatically correct or accord with linguistic conventions, and also those not unlike what the appearance sensibly is or may not be. There are also statements that correspond with reality, such as a biography of a real person, and ones do not like The Lord of the Rings.<p>I think of these things in terms of physically encoded information. There is the collection of hypothetical information that could exist such as plays Shakespeare never wrote, and the subset of information that does because it exists in a physically encoded form. I&#x27;m not a Platonist, what we call a circle is a description of a geometric form, and a real geometric form is a circle to the extent that it matches that description. There is no abstract form called circles that exists in any sense, or any world of forms for them to exist in. Actually I don&#x27;t think Plato thought there was either but he didn&#x27;t have a robust account of information to work with.<p>Taking this to the relationship with science, there are many, many valid and consistent mathematical formulae, descriptions, theorems, etc that are proven but have no correspondence with anything in physical reality. No process, no physical structure that they describe. These are like literary fictions describing a fantasy world, although they may be mathematically rigorous. However there are some mathematical descriptions that do accurately correspond to relationships and processes in the physical world, and we can use them to predict the behaviours of those physical processes. This is because, fortunately, the physical processes occurring in the world are highly consistent and persistent, and therefore can be described in a highly consistent formal language such as mathematics. We call those physical laws, though I hate the term laws. They are simply predictive descriptions of behaviour we have observed.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
