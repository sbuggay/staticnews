I remember in 2012 we joked that if you used enough Javascript you could get the Web in 2012 up to the level that VisualBasic 1.0 offered back in 1991. But we were certain that in 10 years, by 2022, we&#x27;d up to the level offered by VisualBasic 6.0, which would have been amazing, because VisualBasic 6.0 had been amazing.<p>I&#x27;ve been stunned by the lack of progress. The major browser companies&#x2F;projects have largely stopped innovating. The period from 1993 to maybe 2010 or 2015 was very fluid, and HTML and CSS expanded quickly, but after a certain point the attitude seemed to be &quot;We don&#x27;t need to fix HTML because we can fix it with Javascript.&quot; Which is sort of true, but it is clunky. It would be much better to simply add more to HTML. At a minimum, every form element offered by VisualBasic should have eventually been added to HTML. What is the hold up? Why isn&#x27;t this happening?<p>It&#x27;s shocking, but there are still no calendars in HTML. Every calendar has to be custom built with CSS and Javascript. You&#x27;d think in the year 2024 we&#x27;d have every possible time element added to HTML, with easy customization options. I&#x27;m baffled this hasn&#x27;t happened yet.<p>What will it take to get the major browser companies&#x2F;projects to start adding more to HTML?</div><br/><div id="39700502" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39700502" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">marcus_holmes</span><span>|</span><a href="#39699742">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39699823">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39700022">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39700502">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39700502">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think Web Components was seen as the fix for this; that (in the same way VB4 did) we&#x27;d have packages of standard components as building blocks for UIs. So rather than each browser implementing a calendar defined in HTML, you&#x27;d use a third-party library Web Component that implemented a calendar.<p>Which is happening. You can get a Web Component calendar, and they mostly work. I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s taking off as &quot;the way&quot; for doing web UI (yet). This might change, I guess. But probably not.<p>I think the big difference from the VB days is design. In the old days, we dev monkeys would design UIs by slapping together controls in a form. Which is why they all looked the same, and while they worked well they didn&#x27;t exactly inspire.<p>Now in Web Dev we have designers as the first step, and every designer designs their UI differently. You can&#x27;t slap together a UI and call it done. Well, you can, and I do, but everyone thinks the result is ugly and needs a designer to make it usable - we&#x27;ve moved the bar of acceptable aesthetics to the point where this VB way of creating UIs doesn&#x27;t work any more.</div><br/><div id="39700649" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39700649" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">smaudet</span><span>|</span><a href="#39699742">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39700502">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39700022">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39700649">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39700649">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">You hit the nail on the head (well, half) - design is an incredibly tricky problem.<p>Mostly because it at its core is the process of adding constraints, and once you&#x27;ve added those its far harder to un-add them. That&#x27;s why CSS was so janky for so long - there were design paradigms (tables, box model, flex box, etc) and once they were there, you hoped they worked and you hoped that your specific design didn&#x27;t break one of its core assumptions, leading to large amounts of work-around code that was either slow or exhibited constant random bugs in different versions of browsers...<p>The other half of the nail was backwards compatibility. Unfortunately you can&#x27;t have web components <i>and</i> your stuff working on 20 year old devices. So any new design&#x2F;paradigm etc. served to splinter the ecosystem (your stuff only works on this browser, that device, our operating system).<p>Graceful degradation sort-of would have provided a work around, but it would have done so by shifting the workload onto the provider (please make sure your calendar works, in these browser, and also has fallback implementations as a clock that doesn&#x27;t break your back-end code because they entered hours as farsi, test on on these 40 browsers and also target moving backends). So instead we invented polyfills as a way of &quot;automatically&quot; back-filling for a lot of stuff.<p>Unfortunately, you can&#x27;t do much about the Web Component calendar. The design paradigm that once existed doesn&#x27;t support it without a lot of busy work, even if newer browsers could natively implement one and never load a line of javascript or any of your shitty thousand line long html layout code...<p>I don&#x27;t think its a completely lost cause, HTMX + Web Components seems like our best path forward so far. Right now, a lot of people who&#x27;ve written millions of lines in non-html frameworks like React and the like are very reluctant to give up their codebase(s), however terrible they might be. It is unfortunately, the result of someone somewhere making a design decision that added constraints, now causing headaches and difficulties un-adding those constraints...</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39700022" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39700022" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">yen223</span><span>|</span><a href="#39699742">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39699823">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39700502">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39699850">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39700022">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39700022">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; What is the hold up?

The problems come from browsers natively implementing all of these things, in ways that are almost, but not quite, good enough for those web apps. The browser has the Python standard library problem of being &quot;where modules go to die&quot;, but even worse since browsers can never deprecate anything; as a result we have all these 80% implementations that don&#x27;t quite solve the problem but are enough to suck all the oxygen away from any good solutions. And then we just pile hacks on hacks to improve these things without ever fixing the underlying stuff. I mean FFS, Chrome will save and sync passwords that I enter in some web form flow based on heuristics, but it won&#x27;t save actual username&#x2F;passwords that I enter via the built-in username&#x2F;password functionality that the browser has; how screwed up is that?<p>If I was somehow king of the web, what I&#x27;d be looking to do is: standardise one of the various &quot;web components&quot; proposals that lets people implement custom tags as libraries. Reimplement almost all of the things that are currently implemented as browser builtins as web components instead, move them out of the core rendering engine and into what are effectively polyfills-in-reverse; make the actual &quot;browser&quot; piece only implement div&#x2F;span&#x2F;canvas or something. Normalise pages loading components from libraries, where they can be iterated on and improved more quickly.<p>But for some reason web folks and especially HN seem to hate the few parts of the web technology stack that actually work well (Javascript, NPM) and love implementing as much as possible in the parts that are awful and unfixable (CSS).

That works in small groups but it is highly misleading in large ones. In large groups, the only factors that matter are incentives and competence. If the incentives are good and the people are competent, good results will happen. If the reverse, corruption. The motivation heuristic actually does a lot of harm because it causes a huge amount of noise in the discourse where people whinge about this person or that having bad character to no avail. It is often true that people have impure motivations, but at scale that is true of effectively everyone. There are the devils you know and the devils waiting to become known.

Not in the sense of features or flagship sites—web-based email clients and word processors and image editors are all waaay better than they used to be and I would say the high-quality stuff is of higher quality than ever. I’m not pining for the HTML-only version of GMail, I promise. But if I were to estimate some rough median of “how well do websites work” I would also say that there’s an incredible amount of jank out there.<p>Nah. I remember that era. It all sucked, except Flash, which was the only way to have interactive sites that weren&#x27;t awful. The main reason websites work even less well now is that they got rid of Flash so you have to use an informally-specified bug-ridden implementation of half of Flash instead.<p>&gt; They expect the Back button to work, and they expect that the stuff they filled out on the previous page will be there when they click it. And it would! If you would just let the browser do what it wants to do!<p>That&#x27;s a very recent change, and only after a literal decade of people using javascript to do this put enough pressure on browser makers to fix such basic functionality. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s even implemented in all common browsers yet.<p>&gt; Every broken contact form or booking site is a truly spectacular own-goal. If your calendar was a bunch of progressively enhanced checkboxes and a submit button, you could be riding off into the sunset and counting money instead of taking support calls from frustrated octogenarians.<p>Nah. If you did that progressive enhancement nonsense it would take 3x as long and would still work less well. Frankly the biggest thing holding back the web is the opposite, people keep trying to use the broken and awful browser widgets and technologies instead of declaring bankruptcy and just rendering their system via one big canvas element like you would if you were writing a program in a real programming language. We&#x27;ve been trying progressive enhancement for 30 years and it still sucks; how bad does it have to get before we start trying something different?</div><br/><div id="39701566" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39701566" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">WA</span><span>|</span><a href="#39700350">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39700718">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39701566">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39701566">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; and just rendering their system via one big canvas element<p>Interesting perspective, but I&#x27;m not sure if this would really solve the problem. You&#x27;d have to implement so much functionality that we take for granted (selecting text, copy &amp; paste, accessibility, keyboard shortcuts, etc.). If you don&#x27;t want to do it yourself, you have to use a widget library or some kind of UI kit. Maybe like Flutter. The web-version of a Flutter app renders everything to canvas (with a lot of caveats).<p>Since people bring their own UI libs for their JS-CSS-HTML web apps all the time, they will probably do the same with a pure canvas implementation and the result would be even shittier, because half of them will forget basic functionality.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39700718" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39700718" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">d--b</span><span>|</span><a href="#39700350">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39699904">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39700718">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39700718">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is utter bullshit.
