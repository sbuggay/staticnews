For God&#x27;s sake, we even have enough compute to run monstrous language models; I have an inkling that kind of compute would go a long way on simulating cellular processes.

In the case of physical illness, the patient’s death is not even the half way mark for the carer’s experience.<p>My point is not to say that patients have it easy, but that both parties have their burdens to bear, and it is not necessary for every essay to cover both sides.<p>Edit: I see you have deleted your comment, which is a shame, I don’t think you should be afraid to express this sentiment.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37747122" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37747122" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">msmithstubbs</span><span>|</span><a href="#37747095">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37747254">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37747129">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37747122">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37747122">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Jake has his own site where he shares his essays here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jakeseliger.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jakeseliger.com</a></div><br/><div id="37747125" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37747125" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">notamy</span><span>|</span><a href="#37747095">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37747122">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37747129">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37747125">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37747125">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thank you!
