Because that&#x27;s often what ends up happening, and you (and your colleagues) will be much happier working over the next many months or years inside a project where there was at least some thought given to architecture and abstractions when it was started.<p>The only time where I think a rewrite might be warranted is if you, no matter how hard you profile and work on it, have realized that the framework (or even language runtime&#x2F;interpreter) you have built on is just not going to give you the performance you need.  Even then, you should really be sure that you can&#x27;t optimize it better, even if that means digging into the framework you&#x27;re using to make changes.  (Digging into the language runtime or interpreter might be a step too far, though, depending on the circumstances.)<p>But otherwise... nah, it&#x27;s probably not worth it, unless you&#x27;re doing it on your own time, as a toy project, for learning or just fun.  I might take an old personal project written in C and decide to rewrite it in Rust because I&#x27;m sick of C, and just don&#x27;t care to work on it anymore, even though there are more things I want to do with that project.  Now, I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s necessarily a <i>good</i> reason to do it, but if I have no professional obligations around that code, it&#x27;s my prerogative to spend my time however I want.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39557121" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39557121" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bdw5204</span><span>|</span><a href="#39559940">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39556188">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39557121">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39557121">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The main reason why developers do rewrites is because it is easier to read your own code than it is to read somebody else&#x27;s code. Doing a rewrite means you only have to work with code that was written by your current coworkers or by yourself.<p>This is also the core motivation behind all of the schemes to force a single coding style on all developers at the cost of performance and usually with an extremely complicated design for seemingly no reason. Usually, these turn out to be unreadable messes as well a generation later once everybody has moved onto the latest and &quot;greatest&quot; coding style trend.<p>Instead of doing rewrites, you can just refactor code. That means, among other things, deleting obsolete code for platforms you no longer support and, in the case of C&#x2F;C++, converting macros to functions. You can also document the codebase (with comments not commit messages) so that developers understand what the code does and why it is there. But a full rewrite is usually a bad idea that will just introduce new bugs and remove existing functionality.<p>Refactor vs rewrite is basically the software development equivalent of reform vs revolution in political science and everybody with even a minimal knowledge of history knows that revolutions usually end badly with an even worse regime taking power. Likewise, the failure to accept the need for reform (i.e. refusing to allow refactoring) inevitably leads to revolution.</div><br/><div id="39558655" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39558655" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ehnto</span><span>|</span><a href="#39557121">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39558624">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39558655">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39558655">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is why I recommend using a framework in commercial projects, and following it&#x27;s idioms as closely as makes sense for your project.<p>It means there is a shared idiomatic approach across your team and all the documentation for it is just the framework documentation.

Most or all of the people that has initially created the system have moved on to other positions or companies.

Users do not typically spend much time reaffirming the features that are working well.<p>One of the challenges of working with stakeholders is that close to 100% of the communication tends to be on things that are not working or are missing or they want to get done. As a developer or manager of the team, you need to find some way of answering the question &quot;am I doing well?&quot;. Because users are of course unhappy with how the application works, but to understand levels of unhappiness you need to find some other reference (working for some other projects).<p>I was yesterday in a meeting with developers where they complained about how manual our deployment system is.<p>Our deployment system requires them to press a button to deploy a version of the application to the environment. Yes, log in and press a button.<p>I explained, that I worked in the past for teams that had hundred page manuals on how to compile and deploy the software and that manual would be compiled again and again for each release and the process would take from couple of days to a whole quarter.<p>So you need to have some perspective to be able to judge that kind of feedback.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39556761" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39556761" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">asadotzler</span><span>|</span><a href="#39556188">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39556485">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39559959">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39557227">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39556761">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39556761">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">that only really works for static or mostly stable requirements. not so great for something like the fast evolving web platform of the late 90s when we re-wrote the Netscape&#x2F;Mozilla rendering engine.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39557227" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39557227" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Aurornis</span><span>|</span><a href="#39556188">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39556485">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39558548">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39557227">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39557227">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In my experience, the biggest factors are:<p>* Many developers prefer working on greenfield code rather than adding to an old codebase<p>* Working on a rewrite buys you some time in limbo where you can write code while being free from the burdens of production operations.

Unfortunately, production-grade C code is <i>much</i> harder than most people think it is.  The bug reports in core code used throughout the system often to lead to functions that weren&#x27;t even on the right track for the quality level of C that we needed.  So I started killin&#x27; code that needed killin&#x27;.  Management seemed to approve of those decisions, and I don&#x27;t think I stepped on any toes.  (I suspect that the recent grads who&#x27;d written code like homework assignments didn&#x27;t care if anyone rewrote it, so long as it was done quietly.)<p>Another time, there was a single Web service endpoint that pretty much <i>had</i> to work correctly, if the company was going to stay in business.  So I rewrote it much more methodically and resilient than Web backend code typically gets written.<p>There was another time I simply walked away from a new consulting project, once I saw the code and realized that it was unsalvageable, and that the client wouldn&#x27;t understand rewriting.  (Imagine an undergrad who enthusiastically kludged together something demo-grade from numerous off-the-shelf components, and now the client &quot;just needs someone to polish it up and extend it&quot;.)  The functionality could&#x27;ve been recreated rapidly, and rock-solid, in a fraction of the time it would take to start to improve this code.  The barrier was political, and since it was a new client, and looking like it would be a bad client, not worth the ulcers to salvage.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39556089" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39556089" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">QuadmasterXLII</span><span>|</span><a href="#39558671">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39559665">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39556089">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39556089">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My guess at the problem: we all feel a sense of relief when the codebase gets smaller, but making an existing, working codebase smaller is really, really hard work.

You can make a change and feel confident that you&#x27;ve not broken anything outside of the area that you&#x27;re working on because the (mostly integration) test suite continues to pass.<p>Likewise, documentation. Without good, comprehensive documentation you quickly find that there are all sorts of areas of the project that you don&#x27;t understand - which can also make a rewrite feel like it could be justified.<p>The catch there is that you have to _trust_ your documentation.

Rewriting 1%, 10% or even 50% would make no sense and essentially get us little or nothing.<p>Yes, you need to know what you&#x27;re doing if you plan to rewrite anything, and make sure that the people who know the little legacy details of your system are around, but it&#x27;s absolutely the right thing to do in many situations.</div><br/><div id="39556304" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39556304" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cyberax</span><span>|</span><a href="#39556203">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39556769">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39556304">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39556304">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">50-100K LOC are less than the amount of code for the build system in a couple of projects I worked on.</div><br/><div id="39556401" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39556401" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">prmph</span><span>|</span><a href="#39556203">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39556304">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39556769">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39556401">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39556401">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Then you&#x27;ve got bigger problems</div><br/><div id="39556810" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39556810" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pixl97</span><span>|</span><a href="#39556203">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39556401">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39558003">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39556810">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39556810">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It turns out a lot of people have a lot of problems bigger than yours.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39558003" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39558003" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cyberax</span><span>|</span><a href="#39556203">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39556401">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39556810">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39557226">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39558003">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39558003">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Oh, for sure.
