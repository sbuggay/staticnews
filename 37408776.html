And I think we can say this was a catastrophic failure.<p>Think about it, first you need a race condition, and that race condition has to result in the unexpected result. That right there, assuming this code has been tested and is frequently used, is probably a less than 10% chance (if it was frequently happening someone would have noticed.) Then you need an engineer to decide they need this particular crash dump. Then you need your credential scanning software (which again, presumably usually catches stuff) to not be able to detect this particular credential. Now you need an account compromised to get network access and that user has access to this crash dump and the hacker happens to get to it and grabs it.<p>But even then, you should be safe because the key is old and is only good to get into consumer email accounts...except you have a bug that accepts the old key AND a bug that didn&#x27;t reject this signing key for a token accessing corporate email accounts.<p>This is a really good system engineering lesson. Try all you want eventually enough small things will add up to cause a catastrophic result. The lesson is, to the extent you can, engineer things so when they blow-up the blast radius is limited.</div><br/><div id="37415008" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37415008" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rdtsc</span><span>|</span><a href="#37414920">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37415762">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37415008">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37415008">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; that eventually in the right succession result in catastrophic failure.<p>With a caveat that when it comes to security the eventual succession doesn&#x27;t come as a random process but will be actively targeted and exploited.
