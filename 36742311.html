Write, compile, yell at compiler, push, complain about how slow CI is, deploy. You know, the usual.<p>I think the most interesting difference is the _onboarding_ curve. Haskell&#x27;s curve is pretty brutal, although I think most of this is because of bad pedagogy (many monad tutorials are bad, and beginners can&#x27;t tell) rather than because of intrinsically difficult concepts. Some observations:<p>1. Empirically, zero to code review is roughly six weeks for a professional industry software engineer. It&#x27;s not that much longer than other languages we&#x27;ve had to teach. But it _feels_ very brutal because zero to side project is roughly three or four weeks. Contrast this against Go, where zero to side project is about five minutes.<p>2. Having an experienced Haskell engineer on your team to start with makes a WORLD of a difference. You&#x27;ve gotten a type error - why? Is it because GHC is doing weird backwards type inference stuff again? Or is it because you&#x27;ve misunderstood this fundamental concept? Or is it because you&#x27;ve done a typo, and GHC has inferred a downstream site to be a type error? This sort of thing is very difficult to explain in words and in general, and much easier to pick up through experience and mentorship. If you do not have an experienced Haskeller at your disposal, I would strongly recommend starting with side projects first, and using the Functional Programming Slack (fpslack.com), who are some of the friendliest and most patient folks I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of talking to.</div><br/><div id="36744918" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36744918" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Tade0</span><span>|</span><a href="#36743834">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36744492">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36744368">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36744918">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36744918">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; (many monad tutorials are bad, and beginners can&#x27;t tell)<p>It appears monads truly are something you can either understand or explain, but not both.<p>I find it suspicious.

For context, I work at FOSSA (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fossa.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fossa.com&#x2F;</a>). Our core product solves software supply chain needs in enterprises (around licensing and security), and our core technology is around compiler, build, and source code analysis.<p>Off the top of my head, 3 advantages stood out:<p>1. First, if you&#x27;re not going that far off the beaten low-level path, Haskell has incredible productivity benefits. Effect tracking has enormous benefits for testability and understandability. If you&#x27;ve ever been down a debugging rabbit hole shaped like &quot;there&#x27;s no way this logging call is sending that API request&quot;, then you might be pleasantly surprised to discover that you can statically guarantee that this doesn&#x27;t occur in Haskell programs! Pattern matching, algebraic data types (sum types!), and typeclass derivation make it much easier to make it impossible to construct invalid representations of data. Other languages are finally picking this up, but their versions of pattern matching often have caveats for backwards-idiom-compatibility. And monads are a very powerful abstraction. It&#x27;s like being able to write your own semantics for async-await (I&#x27;ve talked more about this before at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lobste.rs&#x2F;s&#x2F;7cllte&#x2F;monads_part_six_really_what_is_monad#c_nbusni" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lobste.rs&#x2F;s&#x2F;7cllte&#x2F;monads_part_six_really_what_is_mo...</a>).<p>2. Haskell was a good domain fit for us. One thing we build is the FOSSA CLI (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fossas&#x2F;fossa-cli&#x2F;">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fossas&#x2F;fossa-cli&#x2F;</a>), which runs in customer CI pipelines to analyze their builds. It&#x27;s a very compiler-shaped problem: shell out to some tools, do a lot of parsing, think very hard, and then spit out a JSON blob to send back to the API. Our first version of this was written in Go. At the time of development, writing correct, testable parsers in Go was like pulling teeth. We have a relatively small headcount-to-product-surface-area ratio, and our team was running up against the overhead of rewriting traverse in Go over and over again (that&#x27;s a Haskell-flavored joke, but if you&#x27;ve ever been annoyed at writing yet another for-loop in Go, you get it). We decided to hack out a prototype in Haskell, and it turned out to be a good fit.<p>3. Lastly, the kind of people who wind up working at FOSSA and are interested in the code analysis bits tend to be the same kind of nerds who love Haskell. We had lots of people on our team who were chomping at the bit to try it, so we decided to try it out. I really can&#x27;t understate how big of a productivity difference it makes when people are working with tools that they actually enjoy rather than are merely forcing themselves to use. It is night and day.<p>If you want to learn more, we also did an interview with Serokell on this topic (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;serokell.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;haskell-in-production-fossa" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;serokell.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;haskell-in-production-fossa</a>), and discussed it on an episode of our engineering podcast (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fossa.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;fossa-podcast-adopting-haskell&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fossa.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;fossa-podcast-adopting-haskell&#x2F;</a>).</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36743447" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36743447" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jacknews</span><span>|</span><a href="#36743834">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36743276">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36743447">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36743447">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Maybe I misunderstand; is this as it says, the <i>cummulative</i> number of jobs posts since 2008?

The selling points of high assurances by their compilers appealed to me.<p>Opinion:
Something I did not anticipate is these languages allow a high degree of individual choice in coding style by a programmer, and companies tend to dislike this. I have read this sentiment about Clojure shops; the original authors are very capable in the codebase but it can be hard to bring in new team members later. It seems to me most companies prefer less expressive languages with opinionated style guidelines. I have never worked with Python professionally, but apparently there is a high emphasis on style consistency in the community.<p>Obviously there exist projects in less expressive languages that are hard to maintain, so maybe ease-of-onboarding and ease-of-maintenance depend on something else.<p>I still believe the type system of Haskell can provide great benefits to codebase maintenance over the long term. If the coding style were restricted and opinionated, it might assist with company adoption.</div><br/><div id="36744459" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36744459" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Tanjreeve</span><span>|</span><a href="#36742998">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36744240">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36744371">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36744459">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36744459">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">If your products biggest concern is fungibility of developers and controlling what developers can do then you likely wouldn&#x27;t be getting any value from any of the group of expressive languages anyway.<p>&gt;Obviously there exist projects in less expressive languages that are hard to maintain<p>This is the flip side of more conservative language choices. The moment you&#x27;re off the beaten path you&#x27;re doing way more custom stuff to work around the language. My favourite one I point at is Instagram&#x27;s use of Python is commonly held up as &quot;Python can do everything&quot; but when you read their tech blogs you&#x27;re basically reading &quot;here&#x27;s how we got some extremely skilled specialist language Devs to Jerry rig custom functionality onto python to create a flavour that could be doing absolutely anything. All to avoid hiring a few devs with a copy of a standard manual for some other language.<p>&gt; I still believe the type system of Haskell can provide great benefits to codebase maintenance over the long term. If the coding style were restricted and opinionated, it might assist with company adoption.<p>Counterpoint. What if it&#x27;s an impossible task for languages to encode a business domain and they should give your developers the tools to do it and then get out of the way? Its still opinionated. Its just that the opinions are coming from your businesses stack.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36744371" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36744371" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">grumpyprole</span><span>|</span><a href="#36742998">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36743497">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36744240">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36743535">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36744371">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36744371">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Haskell is a well designed language.
