I struggled in that new role and he noticed that. He then terminated our agreement two months early.<p>There are reasons he&#x27;s right about what he did and there are reasons I&#x27;m right about being upset about it but it definitely cost us our friendship.<p>I think back that if he had operated with integrity and honored his agreement to keep me on for two extra months it would have not been upsetting to leave then. As it was it left me scrambling with three small kids.<p>The lesson to me is that even if the startup is flush with cash, there will be issues. How the founder manages those issues matters.<p>I recall when I had my startup I did a bunch of business coaching and really had to take on a lot of uncomfortable things about myself. I&#x27;m grateful for that. I invited him many times to participate in that work and he never did.

I also don&#x27;t have close family connections at that level. Guess that means I put more importance on friendship.<p>I&#x27;ve had the experience one time of cofounding a company with a friend. It didn&#x27;t end badly, but it wasn&#x27;t ideal. I realized pretty quickly I was going to be solely responsible  for actually building the product. My partner was a great designer and actually had the business knowledge. To be completely honest we could have made something of it but I wasn&#x27;t in the right place at the time to deep dive. Probably should have carried through with it. We&#x27;d likely be the biggest site to basically do Airbnb for cinema rental locations today. Again, I only say that because he had the connections to make that happen. Not something I could have done on my own<p>I guess I don&#x27;t have any specific advice, other than general history.<p>If you and your friend are highly aligned then make a go of it. But on the contrary, Steve, Steve, and the other cofounders didn&#x27;t agree. One backed out, and Apple became what it is now. Woz and the rest are $$$$$$$$$$$ aires.<p>In the end we all die.

It started out well enough. They offered me sweat equity upfront (no cliffs or vesting) so that showed a lot of trust. 
As time went on, him and his partner began spooling off different companies with no intimation and conflicts of interests. They even diluted my stake without informing. I waited till I was 4 years complete, asked them to hike up my equity stake by a few points as the business while running was not making a load of cash and the salary I was drawing was peanuts compared to the market offers I was saying no to.
They didn&#x27;t respond on that request for a year. Put in my papers. As to how our childhood friendship fared.
