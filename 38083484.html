That area was noticeably more dangerous because you simply see less, and have less reaction time. Especially during rain or snow or other extreme weather. It isn&#x27;t just other cars. It is also deer who might pass the highway, for example. And that area was in a forest. If there were some kind of way to have them more intelligently work on&#x2F;off (for example by seeing phone signals come closer) I&#x27;d wager we&#x27;d already have such.
