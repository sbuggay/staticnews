Concern about loss off creativity in creative exercises: this is a fair UX critique. Personally, I find that using ChatGPT as a rubber duck is extremely valuable, even for complex &quot;softskill&quot; challenges. I wish more tools were built towards this angle, instead of trying to just do the work with AI. I imagine an LLM auto-writing text like now, with subsequent UX highlighting points to converse and evolve the artifact.<p>2. Post-scarcity loss of meaning where quality used to be a proxy metric. eg if a professor of status took the time to write a good letter of recommendation, you were really worth it. This was always a flawed and biased system. Same for yearly reviews, and most promo processes. Hopefully society adapts by dropping the fluff in favor of hard data - a bulletpoint list from a professor with some mechanism to verify the number of recommendations made seems better than what we have today.</div><br/><div id="36183718" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36183718" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throwaway290</span><span>|</span><a href="#36180600">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36181850">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36183718">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36183718">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It contaminates not just proxy metrics but the underlying work that metrics are supposed to judge, if you use AI to help with you actual work this work is contaminated with AI&#x27;s premise the same way as the document used as the example in TFA.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36181850" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36181850" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">YeGoblynQueenne</span><span>|</span><a href="#36180600">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36182782">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36181850">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36181850">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;&gt; Professors are asked to write letters for students all the time, and a good letter takes a long time to write.<p>Indeed, and that&#x27;s why you let the student write it for you [1].<p>And then nobody reads it, or if they read it, the ignore it anyway and only look at the student&#x27;s grades, if that.<p>To be honest I don&#x27;t understand recommendation letters.
