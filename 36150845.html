I have a recent Mazda which in almost all ways is my perfect car <i>except</i> for the newfangled safety features all new cars seem to have. Lane correction and emergency braking, even set to the lowest sensitivity levels, are bad to outright dangerous in city (and some country) driving. In NYC it&#x27;s common to have multiple road lines crossing during construction which by default has lead my car to try steering into cyclists or barriers. It can&#x27;t read the lane because the lane is not properly marked but that&#x27;s <i>typical</i>. So I disabled it. Emergency braking is a bit harder for me to understand when it kicks in but I&#x27;ve done whatever I can to keep it off. Twice it caused a hard brake in the middle of traffic with my newborn in the back and almost got me rear-ended. Another time it detected another car ahead of me but technically in the next lane and warned that it was about to hard brake <i>in the rain on the Williamsburg Bridge inner roadway</i> which is... tight to say the least. If there&#x27;s a future where these features are rigorously tested for worst case scenarios in different driving environments <i>and</i> somehow universally implemented across manufacturers... maybe.</div><br/><div id="36159023" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36159023" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hnick</span><span>|</span><a href="#36151343">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36152386">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36161986">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36159023">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36159023">[18 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My new car has lane keep assist and AEB and I haven&#x27;t had these issues. From what I hear it&#x27;s very much to do with a maker&#x27;s implementation (mine is Hyundai, who for various reasons seems to have a bad reputation in North America but a good one in Australia). For the lane keep assist I feel a nudge but it&#x27;s extremely easy to overcome just through a normal grip on the wheel - if I don&#x27;t budge it won&#x27;t move. It&#x27;s been an issue near construction sometimes but also some wider merges where 2 lanes become one (the markings in Canberra seem to confuse it, but not Sydney) so it does depends a lot on road conditions, but as I say it&#x27;s annoying at most and I wouldn&#x27;t call it dangerous in my car and it helps more than it hinders.<p>For AEB, the same system is used in the adaptive cruise control and it&#x27;s been near perfect. One funny thing was that it just alarmed and fully died in outback Victoria - apparently it is coded to do this as a fail-safe if it hasn&#x27;t detected a car for a long time due to the system potentially not working. The service centre employee said Hyundai are working on a patch to extend the timeout since it&#x27;s a little low for country Australian roads (approximately an hour at the moment I think).</div><br/><div id="36162715" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36162715" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">lloeki</span><span>|</span><a href="#36151343">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36159023">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36162641">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36162715">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36162715">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I have a Mazda too, I can confirm GP statement regarding lane assist... in many areas but not all:<p>- when it works it works so well the car basically drives itself esp. when you throw cruise  control into the mix (this includes auto coasting + breaking)<p>- when it doesn&#x27;t it&#x27;s bouncing across the lane + applies too much resistance when attempting e.g overtaking<p>I did not have any issue with emergency braking (never triggered, any situation where it would have triggered got handled by the driver first), but I did have a few (light) phantom braking events in cruise control.<p>Not related to lane assist control (uses a separate mechanism) but I did have issues with blind spot alert, it was randomly alerting regularly when no car was present.

Not an easy task.<p>To give a quick example: another commenter in this thread states that lane assist only kicks in at 35mph. That is true in some models but not all which could lead to some nice surprises. Further, the speed limit in NYC is 25mph so it&#x27;s not unusual if the road surface is decent to be cruising closer to 30.

Meaning that, for example I drive a Honda which has a camera and a radar. The camera is for lane assist from what I gathered and the radar for ACC and AEB.<p>If I accelerate into traffic and get close to a car while accelerating, it will start flashing a warning light and if I still don&#x27;t stop accelerating or braking, it will intervene, but if the other car accelerates it doesn&#x27;t do anything. So the radar setup is quite well done and it gives very few false positives.<p>The lane assist system is a bit bad though because once it identifies the lane markings it does not take into account potential hazards that want me to change a lane or exit it for a few seconds to avoid road hazard lights or something similar.<p>The point I am trying to make is that there should be a high standard to what drives the AEB and it should not rely on cameras, which seems to be what automakers want to implement driving assisted features to save on more advanced tech. And somehow I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re gonna pony up for high-speed cameras that can replace a radar at accuracy.<p>Maybe the intention is good, but most likely the implementation will suck.</div><br/><div id="36162655" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36162655" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">anakaine</span><span>|</span><a href="#36151343">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36162165">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36159591">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36162655">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36162655">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Alternatively, it should have a wider field of view and if nothing is obviously very wrong let the driver move the wheel around without intervention.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36159591" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36159591" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kovacs_</span><span>|</span><a href="#36151343">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36159023">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36160730">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36161031">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36159591">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36159591">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Hyundai had a not so great reputation in the early 2000s in the US.

The reason it&#x27;s a fallacy is that data is itself only a reflection of conscientious decisions about what to measure and how to measure, and these are invariably limited to what we already appreciate and understand, not accounting for the things we don&#x27;t know how to measure and don&#x27;t know we should be measuring.<p>To be more concrete, let&#x27;s say we follow your suggestion and focus on crashes. Maybe it&#x27;s found that automatic breaking reduces the number of crashes so it&#x27;s mandated. But maybe automatic breaking also increases the likelihood that a crash is deadly in some sub-population like pedestrians, construction workers, and motorcyclists. So overall we see crashes decline because a large number of minor crashes are averted but we also see deadly crashes increase because pedestrians, construction workers, and motorcyclists are killed more frequently.<p>So data isn&#x27;t a free lunch. Every decision about what to measure and what to optimize involves some prior contextual understanding.

I&#x27;ve been a licensed driver for over 40 years. I had one minor fender-bender at 16 years old, learned my lesson, and haven&#x27;t had another accident since. I&#x27;m an exceptionally good driver as evidenced by this, plus the fact that I&#x27;ve taken performance driving classes, simulators, and so forth.<p>I, personally, am a much lower risk than the typical driver. Putting a drivers&#x27; aid device in my car may well increase the danger to me and those around me, even while having it in other cars decreases danger.<p>BTW - my car&#x27;s traction control is evil. It&#x27;s a rear wheel drive car, without limited slip. So when I pull out onto the road from a driveway, if there&#x27;s the slightest bit of sand on the road, I get enough spin to engage the traction control. The car deals with this by vastly cutting engine power. In Texas, where the regular surface road I&#x27;m pulling out to is commonly 60mph, and often faster, I need to accelerate quickly to avoid the guy approaching - yet the traction control has just left me wallowing, dead in the water, unable to accelerate strongly. Except in wet conditions, disabling the traction control is always the first thing I do when I sit in the car.</div><br/><div id="36162240" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36162240" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">shortcake27</span><span>|</span><a href="#36151343">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36160072">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36161367">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36162240">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36162240">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Every person on the planet believes they’re an above average driver.

But any sensible person knows that&#x27;s not going to happen. These systems <i>will</i> make mistakes, and some of those mistakes will cause harm. So you can&#x27;t just make a blanket claim that such systems are good. You have to actually look at the data and balance the harm they avoid by doing what they&#x27;re supposed to do when they&#x27;re supposed to do it, against the harm they cause when they make mistakes.<p>The obvious next question is, does the proposed rulemaking here consider the consequences of the system making mistakes? As far as I can tell, the answer is no, with just one qualifier. The claims about crashes prevented and lives saved are not net savings, accounting for harm done by the system making mistakes; those claimed numbers assume the systems will always perform perfectly and will never <i>cause</i> any harm, only prevent it. The one qualifier is that the proposal does include two &quot;false positive&quot; tests to try to spot systems that brake when they&#x27;re not supposed to. But there is no analysis given to show why those particular false positive tests were picked or why they would justify the extremely high level of confidence in the systems not making errors that the rest of the proposal shows.</div><br/><div id="36159086" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36159086" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hnick</span><span>|</span><a href="#36151343">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36158762">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36161191">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36159086">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36159086">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think there is one other aspect to consider.

Pretty much all my experiences with these kinds of features have been poor.  I turned off the emergency breaking on our Tesla after it slammed on the brakes for no reason on the highway a couple of times.  Could easily cause someone to rear-end you.  I also recall a Kia I rented once that had automatic lane keep assist and blind spot warnings. The blind spot warning was so sensitive that it would loudly beep at you if there was another vehicle anywhere near you in the other lane when you put your turn signal on.  Not helpful, and quite distracting.  The lane keep assist was worse, because the way it pulled on the wheel any time you approached the edge of a lane (which it turns out you do often in the course of regular driving for all kinds of reasons - another car crowding you, giving room to a cyclist, taking a smoother line through a corner, etc.) felt very much like losing traction.  It was quite disconcerting, and I could see it causing someone to overcorrect and lose control.  And to paraphrase Matt Farah, if you need assistance to keep in your lane, you shouldn&#x27;t be driving.<p>All that said, I do like the autosteer on the Tesla, with the caveat that you need to treat it like cruise control, NOT like &quot;autopilot&quot;.

It is beyond belief how broken it is and I would love to see their internal stats for how often their EAB caused - not prevented - single vehicle accidents.</div><br/><div id="36159111" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36159111" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">IanCal</span><span>|</span><a href="#36151896">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36152453">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36158630">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36159111">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36159111">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">At the very least it sounds like people will benefit from actual tests and requirements about how the braking system must act.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36158630" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36158630" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ghostpepper</span><span>|</span><a href="#36151896">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36152357">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36152453">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36158779">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36158630">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36158630">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">There needs to be a tiered license then - if you pass the more rigorous exam you can drive cars without the extra &quot;safety&quot; features.

   &gt; The foregoing review of the statistical case for helmet legislation suggests that the faith of the BMJ in the reliability of the statistical evidence on the effect of helmet legislation is misplaced. But debates about sophisticated statistics should not be allowed to drown out the voice of common sense. The risk compensation hypothesis is essentially common sense. There is a wealth of evidence from everyday experience that suggests that people&#x27;s behaviour is influenced by their perception of risk. People tend to be more cautious when up high ladders than when up low ladders. They tend to take more care when standing on the edge of a high precipice than when standing on a low kerb. They tend to slow down when they encounter bends in the road or patches of fog and to speed up when the road becomes straight or the visibility good-and so on. The possible illustrations of the phenomenon are countless.

   &gt; There is an impressive amount of propaganda designed to encourage people to believe that they are very much less vulnerable when using seat belts and motorcycle helmets, and common sense suggests that driving behaviour will be influenced by safety devices that diminish the user&#x27;s sense of vulnerability. What unaided common sense cannot predict is whether the behavioural changes induced by a safety device will partly, completely, or more than completely nullify the intended effect of the device.

   &gt; The statistics which the NHTSA considers the most compelling evidence in support of helmet legislation are displayed in figure 1. The state which Watson et al (1980) consider has had the greatest increase in deaths as result of helmet law repeal is Utah. 

   &gt; When the distorting effects of the analytical methods employed by the NHTSA and Watson et al are removed, their data (with the caveats discussed above) suggest that the effect, if any, of helmet legislation on motorcycling fatalities is perverse.

I&#x27;ll have to read the paper with more attention later to see if I agree with this, but it&#x27;s a fascinating hypothesis regardless.<p>Also, this is tangential, but I&#x27;m always impressed how different conclusions can be based on the same sets of data.

They also reduce general respect for laws and regulations among the public: people start to view driving, for example, as a game to avoid being caught doing things that are technically illegal but which the vast majority of people do anyway (such as exceeding posted speed limits). Fostering that kind of mentality among the public arguably increases the amount of harm that happens.<p>Furthermore, government institutions, particularly in the post-COVID era, simply lack credibility when they make claims about some government mandate reducing harm.

Are you claiming none of those make driving safer?</i><p>The question is not whether these things make driving safer as compared to not having them.<p>The question is whether the government regulations we have, which include requiring these things but also include lots of <i>other</i> regulations that have far worse justifications (if they even have justifications at all and aren&#x27;t just blatant attempts to extort the public, such as speed traps), are a better system, on net, than a system in which such things were a matter of voluntary choice, <i>but</i> we forced people to bear the consequences of their bad choices. Oh, you weren&#x27;t wearing a seat belt and you got in an accident? Sorry, your insurance company will not cover the medical costs due to injuries you suffered that the seat belt would have prevented (or you have a much higher deductible in such a case). Oh, you hit something while backing up and you didn&#x27;t put a rear view camera in your car? Same sort of answer from your insurance company. Oh, you hit something because you didn&#x27;t have anti-lock brakes and so you couldn&#x27;t steer to avoid the collision? Same answer.<p>In other words, if it is in fact true that these various technologies reduce the risk of accidents, then people who know they will have to take the consequences if they cause an accident will use these technologies to reduce that risk. But in our present regime, our society appears to be violently allergic to such things. The very existence of no fault auto insurance, for example, indicates that we don&#x27;t like the idea of having to take the consequences of bad choices--but the result is that <i>everyone</i> pays more for auto insurance (IIRC, average rates in no fault states are about twice what they are in states that don&#x27;t have no fault).<p>We would all be better off if we abandoned the idea that government regulation can magically protect people from bad consequences. We would also all be better off if we abandoned the idea that we can somehow magically have a government that <i>only</i> makes good regulations, and accepted the inconvenient truth that government regulations come as a package, which even if it contains some good regulations contains many more bad ones, and all things considered is a net cost to us all, not a net gain. We need to stop depending on the nanny state to protect us and be responsible adults who are capable of judging risks and acting accordingly.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36151773" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36151773" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">taeric</span><span>|</span><a href="#36151038">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36151733">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36151551">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36151773">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36151773">[14 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I mean, I can certainly agree that there is a thing as regulatory capture.

They are <i>not</i> just passive safety features with no downside.</div><br/><div id="36158931" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36158931" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ceejayoz</span><span>|</span><a href="#36151038">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36158852">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36159142">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36158931">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36158931">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The car industry fought seatbelts and airbags.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;1975&#x2F;04&#x2F;06&#x2F;archives&#x2F;industry-resists-carsafety-costs-companies-feel-consumers-will.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;1975&#x2F;04&#x2F;06&#x2F;archives&#x2F;industry-resists...</a><p>Your claims about widespread voluntary adoption appear false.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.history.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;seat-belt-laws-resistance" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.history.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;seat-belt-laws-resistance</a><p>&gt; At the time, only 14 percent of Americans regularly wore seat belts, even though the federal government required lap and shoulder belts in all new cars starting in 1968.</div><br/><div id="36159299" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36159299" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">pdonis</span><span>|</span><a href="#36151038">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36158931">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36159290">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36159299">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36159299">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content"><i>&gt; The car industry fought seatbelts and airbags.</i><p>But, as far as I can tell from the article, the industry is not fighting this regulation.</div><br/><div id="36159329" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36159329" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ceejayoz</span><span>|</span><a href="#36151038">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36159299">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36159290">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36159329">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36159329">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The parent post claimed they and the American public voluntarily opted for seat belts and airbags, which as far as I can tell was a falsehood.
