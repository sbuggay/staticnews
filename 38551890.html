(I use the term &quot;common law&quot; loosely here)
Something like a couple of pre-defined categories for software services (e.g. info provider, social network, real-world interface) with pre-set rules (e.g. the client cannot attempt to break the social network; the owner of the social network cannot re-sell data to a third party).<p>We have something like this for brick&#x27;n&#x27;mortar retail already -- each store can&#x27;t just make up their own rules but rather has to operate within a societal framework.<p>The system we have right now leads to every corporation being incentivized to claim as much legal ground as possible in the TOS, leading to a de-facto corpo-state. It also undermines the rule of law in a cultural sense since many things in the TOS may be deemed unenforceable when actually challenged in court. The users will always be is a several disadvantageous bargaining position.</div><br/><div id="38553996" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38553996" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">crote</span><span>|</span><a href="#38552057">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38552745">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38553996">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38553996">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Until your country actually implements laws like these and Hacker News starts complaining that it is &quot;business hostile&quot; and &quot;stifling innovation&quot;.<p>There are plenty of European countries which already have some laws like these.

This type of condition is particularly detrimental to customers in situations where a payment card (debit or credit card) has been assigned to the account, and the operator grants itself the right to automatically charge the new amount for the next subscription period.&quot;</i><p>&gt; <i>&quot;We have been advocating for years that contractual terms should fairly regulate the obligations of the contracting parties. In the case of subscription services, which are gaining popularity, consumers trust the service provider and entrust their payment card data to access and pay their obligations on a regular basis. &gt;&gt;This does not mean that from that point on, operators can, without their consent, charge more than what consumers had previously agreed to&lt;&lt;.&quot;</i><p>&gt; <i>&quot;It is unacceptable to automatically charge according to the amended price list in the form of blocking the funds from the connected payment card or unilaterally introducing significant changes in the contractual terms,&quot;</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uokik.gov.pl&#x2F;aktualnosci.php?news_id=20132" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uokik.gov.pl&#x2F;aktualnosci.php?news_id=20132</a> - the message in Polish<p>It&#x27;s about Amazon here but the office investigates subscription services offered by other companies as well. Amazon EU and Amazon Digital UK cooperated with the office and now will notify their customers about the upcoming changes allowing them to refuse these and break contracts without any penalites. This work for ISP providers already - they can&#x27;t change contracts at own whims; tho, they can pest you with phones with &quot;totally new tied for your needs plans&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s possible to push companies to change their behavior but I doubt this could apply to a specific service that 23andMe is.

The danger isn&#x27;t even necessarily that we gain some crazy ability to predict things about a person from their DNA, but that people <i>believe</i> that it can be done accurately and that police, courts, government, marketers, etc believe it as well.<p>Police don&#x27;t need much convincing if it gets them a conviction. Courts will already admit evidence from forensic labs which have been proven to fabricate evidence. Governments will let just about anything fly if someone donates enough, and if marketers are convinced that it might work, there will be no shortage of cash for campaign funds.<p>Currently, to my knowledge, you can take somebody&#x27;s DNA and do just about anything with it without their knowledge or consent, and there seem to be a lot of well-monied interests with a stake in keeping things that way.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="38552790" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38552790" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Diederich</span><span>|</span><a href="#38551973">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38552537">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38552686">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38552356">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38552790">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38552790">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Hah, beautiful, well done.<p>But yours isn&#x27;t nearly so...catchy looking...as the New Yorker version.</div><br/><div id="38552806" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38552806" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jacquesm</span><span>|</span><a href="#38551973">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38552790">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38552356">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38552806">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38552806">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes, I suck at the eye candy department.
