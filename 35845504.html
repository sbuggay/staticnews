It might go poorly, but I&#x27;m unwilling to write off weird attempts at innovation before the technology has had a chance to evolve in the wild.<p>I&#x27;ve seen several posts lately that have made me feel like the HN sentiment towards Bluesky is negative. Throwing them under the bus for the domain validation mistake. Hatred at commercialization of a protocol. Questioning why Bluesky would do anything but become a worse Twitter since Jack Dorsey is at the helm.<p>C&#x27;mon! At least give it the benefit of doubt while in beta! I, for one, frequently lament how fragmented my IM programs have become. I felt like there was an ideal point where Pidgin + XMPP interfaced with <i>everything</i> and we&#x27;ve slowly walked away from that high water mark. So, approaching communication at the protcol level has a certain appeal. I get the reasoning behind the goal.<p>Do I have concerns that this is another attempt at building a walled garden around something I wish to be open and interoperable? Of course! Do I think it&#x27;s a net negative on society for someone to be making their attempt? No! Bring on the new tech!<p>I wish I had a more nuanced argument to make my case because I&#x27;m sure there will be tons of replies here telling me why my opinion is bad and I&#x27;ll be unable to refute them. And those responses will likely make very fair points, but oh well!

The very good documentation this early in the project! This is not common.<p>2. The very rapid response developer team that does it live! Once the combination of surprisingly rapid membership growth + no blocks blew up and it became an urgent moderation feature, they had blocks within weeks despite the technically challenging task due to the kind of federated protocol and distributing blocklists. You can tell they have seasoned developers on the team. This is not just any kind of gimmick network trying to cash grab on Twitter exodus like I feel Hive Social was. It is an actual attempt at something better than Mastodon that has a fun, social experience with good onboarding and solving account migration headaches in mind.<p>3. The rare service disruptions despite the developers having their plates full and commonly introducing updates to the service. This speaks loudly about software architecture skills and being humble to risk management with good software hygiene. This again is not something that just happens but takes effort, experience and intent.<p>4. The exciting model of DNS approval which I still like. It&#x27;s bloody fantastic to self-verify in a way that actually makes sense, and it feels very &quot;World Wide Web&quot; in a Tim Berners-Lee way. It uses pillars of the modern Internet in a way to strengthen a service and promises verification at scale. It can do company-wide verifications (domain.tld) as well as contributor-specific ones (username.team.company.tld). So, I dearly hope any misuse can be countered.<p>5. I worry they are overreaching with the AT protocol and federation but there is the &quot;Shooting for the stars and aiming for the moon&quot; saying here. I can only wish them the best and if I refer to the points above, the developer team seems surprisingly capable and full of actual intent here.</div><br/><div id="35846336" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35846336" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chefandy</span><span>|</span><a href="#35845731">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35845905">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35845997">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35846336">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35846336">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I really like your take and the one to which it responds.

People are leaving the site because of it, and advertisers are pulling ads.”<p>&gt; That seems bad. Quick, have someone write up some rules against hate speech.<p>People who use slurs are absolute buffoons, and I have no interest in exposing myself to that sort of garbage (so I choose not to go to spaces where it&#x27;s prevalent), however once there is a precedent for acceptable&#x2F;unacceptable speech, and a mechanism where that can be enforced, it&#x27;s inevitable that the definitions expand over time to things that cause advertisers to get squeamish. The paragraph references that very example.<p>The end result is that anything that could be an idea exchange becomes part of a monoculture of corporate controlled platforms with fairly consistent bounds on acceptable speech. This gives a small group of organisations outsized influence over public discourse, and the consequences of that are significant enough that it&#x27;s worth exploring it in depth.<p>I want to be able to access diverse viewpoints, and to engage or ignore as I see fit. I&#x27;m suspicious of anyone who would want to make those decisions for me.<p>There is also a phenomenon where speech outside these bounds prompts people to themselves call for controls and limits to be put in place. I find that very concerning on a societal scale. It works in the interests of those who want to control speech.<p>Having outlets for fringe thoughts is a pressure release valve for the global conversation, and I worry that sanitising the whole thing will radicalise the people who are collecting in what few low touch spaces there are left.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="35847547" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35847547" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eli</span><span>|</span><a href="#35845880">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35847398">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35847645">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35847462">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35847547">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35847547">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">“Censorship” is popular because it works better than the alternatives.

On one hand, if you participate in a system where almost everything is inherently public (the web&#x2F;internet, since anyone can screenshot anything and publish wherever they want), it&#x27;s hardly unexpected that information that was once public, can remain public forever.<p>On the other hand, people have some sort of expectation that the data they publicly post online to remain in some sort of semi-private state.

In practice, this tends to reduce conflict. My concern with Bluesky is that it makes it very possible for tools to make block information easily and automatically accessible - in fact, it would allow a bad actor to create a service that shows a feed of <i>just</i> content from people who want to block you from seeing it.

Inevitably that means lower quality content.
To some extent, more people can make up for it. Eg if I go from 10 excellent artists to 1000 good ones, chances are that the top 10% artwork created actually gets better.<p>&gt; But eventually if you grow by lowering quality, then, well, quality drops.<p>&gt; I suppose for very small societies, they may be limited by discoverability&#x2F;cliquiness and not quality, so their growth doesn’t mesh with quality and so they could also get better with size.<p>&gt; Note, “quality” doesn’t have to mean good&#x2F;bad but also just “property”. When Facebook started, it was for kids from elite schools. It then gradually diluted that by lowering that particular bar. Then it was for kids from all schools. Then young people. Then their parents too. Clearly, it’s far from dying in absolute terms, but it’s certainly no longer what it initially was. To many initial users, it’s as good as dead though.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=31363953" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=31363953</a></div><br/><div id="35846230" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35846230" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">casey2</span><span>|</span><a href="#35845742">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35845888">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35846246">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35846230">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35846230">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Reminds me of the September problem in usenet.<p>My attempt at a solution is to keep it in request-access beta and do targeted advertising only at people who share interests with high-quality subset(s) of discussion on the site, so the new users usually see and can learn what high quality discussion looks like on the site even if all areas aren&#x27;t mature.<p>As the site matures you can naturally let more people in until a quite open beta, then full release trying to never take on more than say 10% of the daily active users in any given section&#x2F;hashtag-cloud per year.</div><br/><div id="35846273" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35846273" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bombcar</span><span>|</span><a href="#35845742">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35846230">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35846246">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35846273">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35846273">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This can be one reason to NOT lock things behind account creation; it lets those who just want to look so so without having to “emigrate”.<p>And you want the community to be able to assimilate those who come in versus the newbies overrunning everything.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="35846246" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35846246" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bombcar</span><span>|</span><a href="#35845742">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35845888">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35846230">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35845845">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35846246">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35846246">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is my “X can restrict who they deal with” (where X is school or church or business or group or whatever) “but the DMV and the police have to deal with everyone” rule.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="35845703" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35845703" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">olah_1</span><span>|</span><a href="#35845742">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35848465">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35845703">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35845703">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Is there such a thing as private posts? or “friends only” posts or something?
