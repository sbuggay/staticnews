Completely programmable.  Completely usable.  But was despised by Steve Jobs.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=C_jug02JATc">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=C_jug02JATc</a><p>I&#x27;m not saying that Steve Jobs wasn&#x27;t successful, or wasn&#x27;t a visionary, or didn&#x27;t save Apple.  I&#x27;m just saying, the Apple II shipped with AppleSoft Basic.  The Mac had no such language or built in compiler.<p>I remember my friend back in college had an Apple IIc, and someone actually wrote a C compiler for it.  He used it AFAIK all the way through college until the mid nineties, 12 years after it&#x27;s original release date roughly in 1984.<p>What I miss about computers from this time is that the Apple IIc had a joystick port.  When I was like 12 (1985ish) I discovered I could get a DB9 connector and got a CDs cell which acted like a light sensitive resistor.  This allowed me to play games that needed only a X or Y axis movement just by hovering my hand over the sensor.<p>Edited to add:<p>To this day, I don&#x27;t own an Apple computer.  The mac&#x27;s were just waaay too expensive.  Around 1996&#x2F;1997 after college, I enjoyed Unix style operating systems more than windows or mac, and promptly got a PC and ran linux on it when I got a full time job out of college.  And linux back then installed a C compiler typically too!!  Windows and mac did not.</div><br/><div id="36351800" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36351800" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sbuk</span><span>|</span><a href="#36346855">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36350431">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36352541">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36351800">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36351800">[12 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Love that you are linking to a piece of fiction, at literal dramatisation of events that almost likely <i>never</i> happened to illustrate a point that has no real foundation in fact.

If alternate app stores existed, it adds additional red tape to get the exploit app removed and potentially allowing more damage to occur.<p>Defense in depth matters.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36351345" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36351345" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">oynqr</span><span>|</span><a href="#36346855">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36350985">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36351537">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36351081">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36351345">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36351345">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Allowing sideloading increases the potential for exploits in IOS to be found<p>That&#x27;s actually a good thing.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36351081" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36351081" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">justinclift</span><span>|</span><a href="#36346855">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36350985">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36351345">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36350636">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36351081">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36351081">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Ahhh.  <i>Sounds like</i> it&#x27;s mostly fear of potential loss rather than something easy to pin down and fix.<p>Yeah, I&#x27;m not aware of any good way to counter that kind of fear unless Apple wants to do so.<p>Unfortunately, countering that fear is 100% the opposite of what Apple want, so they&#x27;re likely going to try and amplify it to the maximum extent instead.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="36350636" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36350636" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wwweston</span><span>|</span><a href="#36346855">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36350207">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36350653">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36352656">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36350636">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36350636">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">What about any suggestion made so far &quot;breaks&quot; the iOS experience for those who are satisfied with it the way it is?</div><br/><div id="36352799" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36352799" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wiseowise</span><span>|</span><a href="#36346855">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36350636">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36352656">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36352799">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36352799">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That’s different™.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36352656" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36352656" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">scrozart</span><span>|</span><a href="#36346855">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36350207">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36350636">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36350543">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36352656">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36352656">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I thought we were on &quot;hacker&quot; news ...</div><br/></div></div><div id="36350994" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36350994" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">flangola7</span><span>|</span><a href="#36346855">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36350207">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36350543">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36349070">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36350994">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36350994">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That should be the default.

If I can’t call clients or pull google maps up, I’m screwed. I have both an iPhone and an Android. I’ve never had an iPhone die for no good reason. Every single android phone I’ve owned prior to my OP 8T has died in under a year. I got hit with the LG bootloop bug on my first android phone and it just went from there.<p>And that’s just hardware. The other day I realized my 8T had bricked itself. I hadn’t used it in a few days, and an OTA update broke something. Wouldn’t flash back the normal way either, I had to go and dig up specialized software and a copy of the ROM from XDA. I’ve never had an iPhone have a bug that a simple reboot wouldn’t fix.<p>The same thing extends to computers too. I think macOS is an abomination, but the hardware they put out it leaps and bounds ahead of pretty much every other manufacturer. In comparison, my surface book 2 has been a steaming pile of shit from day 1. I built my desktop, but my laptop is a MBP. I’d get 3-4 hours of battery on the SB2 with brightness all the way down. The MBP will literally last all day unless I’m running Thinkorswim. Whoever thought that its performance was acceptable should be shot. Even on my desktop it will routinely use 5gb+ RAM alone.</div><br/><div id="36352827" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36352827" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Tainnor</span><span>|</span><a href="#36346855">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36349070">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36352819">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36352827">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36352827">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That may be just you.

If some world government wants to force Apple to allow users to install Debian, Android or whatever onto their iPhone hardware, that&#x27;s great. No downsides. Write the referendum and I&#x27;ll vote in favour.<p>As for the more common refrain that developers should be allowed to distribute apps outside Apple&#x27;s walled garden, that does negatively affect me in three ways:<p>1. Unless Apple is allowed to make side-loading at least as unfriendly as it is on Android, many apps I use today will stop being distributed through the App Store. Want the Gmail app? Download Play Store for iOS. Want Lightroom? Download Creative Cloud Store for iOS. And suddenly all of these apps are no longer subject to Apple&#x27;s strict privacy&#x2F;tracking policies. That sucks.<p>2. I provide tech help to a dozen family members. I can&#x27;t control what they do. I&#x27;ve had enough of dealing with Windows XP machines with Comet Cursor and a dozen other bits of malware on them. These days I&#x27;ve moved the worst offenders to iPads and providing them with tech support is no longer a source of tension headaches. No fucking way I&#x27;m supporting anything that has even the slightest chance of kinking that armour. It doesn&#x27;t matter what I say. These people will follow any instruction provided by Google or Epic to install whatever app they&#x27;ve heard about.<p>3. Maybe I want to develop my own device and I want to write libraries for others to write apps for the device. Why should I support governments forcing device makers to give those libraries away to others and not respect license terms? I&#x27;m all for people hacking into devices they own, but if I distribute something with a license, I want my license terms to be respected - just as someone releasing under AGPL wants that license respected.</div><br/><div id="36353047" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36353047" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mirsadm</span><span>|</span><a href="#36346855">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36350991">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36352962">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36353047">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36353047">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">1.

The ban on third-party iaps was pretty recent on Android, like 2022.<p>For instance:<p>- I made a simple news-sharing app. App Store pushed back against me a few times about the offensive content policy and reporting mechanism not being up to their standards. I never heard back from the Play Store, they just OK&#x27;d it the first time.<p>- I made a college-only dating app. App Store said they won&#x27;t allow any more dating apps that aren&#x27;t different enough (mine wasn&#x27;t), Play Store said ok.<p>- A startup I knew was making an NFT app with a beginner-friendly way to purchase using USD. Apple objected to purchases not going through IAPs. They escalated a bunch of times and eventually got it through.

2. It&#x27;s easier to build a seamless platform when you have control over hardware and software. Look at Mac trackpad as an example; it&#x27;s pretty much beats any PC trackpads.
3. Software sales is where the money is at.

It is super annoying the tech bloggers never pestered Apple to reveal what they said they were going to.<p>Historically Apple always has adjusted the quality of the product to match desired 35% margins and price points. I would be very surprised if the App Store is any different, although they may have had issues ramping up to eat that much money. Apple gouges users...  but they tend to gouge consistently. The other 65% likely includes costs like advertising, cloud services, editorials, legal, fraud costs, WWDC, corporate overhead and the like but it far more than just hosting and evaluation costs. They may be blowing it on Apple TV+ content though.

Additionally, the secure boot chain end-to-end is part of the selling point here.

I could install something very insecure or make bad choices. But then I want to have that choice, and I think it shouldn&#x27;t be so easy that users would just do it by chance. We need to remember there are other social engineering attack vectors against the most secure systems (like asking for passwords, or even asking to lend the phone and so on) too.

Other people can make god-awful decisions that screw you over, and you have no power to stop them.  Or rather:  the app store IS your power to stop them.<p>I can&#x27;t count the number of times I&#x27;ve seen windows users get duped by phishing that gives a bad actor root access.  If that&#x27;s your family member, that&#x27;s YOUR problem; it doesn&#x27;t matter if you were super careful — if your 18 year old son fucks up because he just didn&#x27;t realize he was getting hacked, well — you&#x27;re liable.

You sob and cry about whatever happened to you, and try to &quot;raise awareness&quot; in the open-source community about how maybe we should do something better, and nobody listens.<p>A lot of this stuff in the OSS community reminds me of gun nuts and school shootings; people wring their hands when a personal tragedy happens, the solution is right in front of them should they dare to actually adopt it, but they refuse to adopt it because it&#x27;s ideologically untenable.  So they just pretend the problem never happened until it personally hits their own family — and the worst thing is watching their friends, around them, engage in the same denial.<p>The two &quot;real consequences&quot; are losing your data (drive wipes, randomware, etc), and financial fraud (someone getting your CC number or bank access).

They are pretending that this choice is a natural inevitable result and will always exist. Their whole reasoning that iOS is &quot;ok&quot; is based on the fact that Android - another totally independent ecosystem, exists. And let&#x27;s not forget, it&#x27;s one which Steve Jobs vowed to sue out of existence.<p>The &quot;android&quot; of that ecosystem is the Meta Quest devices. At the moment, yes, you can sideload there and Zuckerberg is on the record saying he will maintain an open ecosystem. Yet it&#x27;s still very tenuous. The sideloading experience is very poor, worse than Android (something you sideload can&#x27;t appear as a first class citizen on the device - there&#x27;s no way to have it show up in the main  app menu, random permissions don&#x27;t work sometimes etc). And the Quest OS layer is <i>not</i> open source - only the underlying Android OS.<p>The technical hurdles required for VR&#x2F;AR are much bigger than general computing. It&#x27;s not at all clear to me that an open alternative will emerge. So we are potentially headed into an era where effectively there&#x27;s no option for general computing that isn&#x27;t locked down and owned by a Mega corporation. And all these iOS users who are preaching tolerance of Apple&#x27;s approach will have been the key enablers of this dystopia.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36348045" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36348045" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cmdli</span><span>|</span><a href="#36346855">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36347807">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36350109">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36353483">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36348045">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36348045">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In that instance, I would say the problem is that the laws around patents are preventing competition, not that one competitor chooses to lock down their system.

I can already guarantee that most developers won&#x27;t budge an inch from the App Store as the lack of discoverability and the annoyance of downloading an app file and clicking through Apple&#x27;s warning popups just to install it would effectively kill their app.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36348294" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36348294" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">kelnos</span><span>|</span><a href="#36346855">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36346964">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36348269">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36348135">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36348294">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36348294">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The alternative to the walled garden of the iPhone isn&#x27;t a device you have to sysadmin.

Stuff like Excel have (historically) been substantially worse than their desktop counterparts on mobile.<p>Now, in some ways I do understand <i>why</i> this is; I suspect the people making the apps figure that if you&#x27;re doing &quot;real&quot; work, you&#x27;ll probably still defer to a &quot;real&quot; computer running Windows or macOS or Linux, but that sort of implies that smartphones <i>aren&#x27;t</i> &quot;real&quot; computers.<p>My iPhone 12 Pro is so much more powerful than a typical Windows 98 computer that I&#x27;m not even sure how you&#x27;d quantify it [1], but if I had to <i>actually</i> do work, it&#x27;s not immediately obvious to me that the iPhone would actually be the superior option. Microsoft Office 98 is still pretty usable, early Photoshop is primitive but still reasonably intuitive, it&#x27;s not hard to get proper text editors.<p>[1] Obviously you can look at clock speeds and &quot;flops per second&quot; and stuff like that, but there&#x27;s other ways that modern computers are more powerful that are less obvious, like custom decoder&#x2F;neural chips, better compilers and more efficient operating systems, etc. I think the safest thing to say is it&#x27;s <i>a lot</i> more powerful.</div><br/><div id="36348009" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36348009" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">memefrog</span><span>|</span><a href="#36347815">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36349296">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36348009">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36348009">[13 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I don&#x27;t think Excel is worse on a phone than on desktop because people don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s capable of &quot;real work&quot;.  It&#x27;s worse because the whole interface of Excel is designed around a mouse and keyboard.  The tiny little cells, the dragging things to be wider and narrower, typing everything - everything is designed around using a very accurate pointer and a keyboard.  I have no idea how you&#x27;d use Excel productively on a phone.  Even if the cells are the same size as they are on a desktop, the screen is tiny, so you&#x27;d not be able to see anything.  And if the cells are smaller, then they&#x27;re even harder to use.  They actually need to be bigger to be a decent touch interface, and then you&#x27;d be constantly scrolling around.<p>The same applies to things like text editors.  Phone keyboards are awful for typing anything except English prose.  The only reason they&#x27;re usable for typing is the autocorrection features.  I turned mine off for a while and then you really realise how precise you have to be to type everything correctly on a phone.  You certainly can&#x27;t write code on them - imagine switching to the symbols keyboard every couple of seconds.  It just doesn&#x27;t make sense.

You can&#x27;t &quot;enable Wayland&quot; anyway because Wayland isn&#x27;t software, it&#x27;s just a protocol.  If you have a problem with Wayland it&#x27;s like having a problem when you enable HTTP&#x2F;2 on your web server.  The problem is with the particular server, or the particular browser, or something in between.  If you have a Wayland issue, you don&#x27;t have a Wayland issue, you actually have a Gnome issue or a Firefox issue or something.<p>Regardless there is no &#x27;Wayland debacle&#x27; that Linux is &#x27;going through&#x27; with &#x27;no clear path forwards&#x27;.  There is a clear path forwards, and it isn&#x27;t really controversial at all.  Wayland is the clear path forwards, and in the long-run is the clearly better choice.  But it is a big change and in an &quot;ecosystem&quot; that is so decentralised that kind of change takes a long, long time.  Enabling Wayland in your particular environment might not be the best choice yet, whether because of bugs with your desktop environment or the applications you use, or because of features that aren&#x27;t there yet or just general instability.  But for most people it&#x27;s been enabled for years and years now and it&#x27;s just... better.  No more screen tearing, no more buggy insecure X display server.  It says something powerful that people whinged and moaned at first about it, but that their revealed preferences tell a different story: <i>nobody</i> was so annoyed that they were prepared to maintain X going forward.

They do have a problem when they just can&#x27;t work out how they&#x27;re meant to get things from one device to another, because it&#x27;s all opaque.  They have to resort to things like sharing a document to themselves via email, then opening the document up in the email app and opening it in another app.  That was the simplest solution that was obvious to my mother, and to be quite fair to her, that probably WAS the simplest way to move a document from one app to another.

Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I <i>do</i>, but only because on most systems its the only reliable way to actually organize the files. But a directory structure isn&#x27;t always the optimal way to organize things for a lot of my access patterns.<p>Like pictures. Maybe I&#x27;m wanting to browse by date. Maybe I&#x27;m wanting to browse by events and albums. Maybe I&#x27;m wanting to browse by photos with these two people in them. Maybe I want to browse by pictures with boats in them. So should I arrange my photos in directories by date, or by album, or by some kind of classification and then date (family&#x2F;2023&#x2F;bobs_birthday)? It sucks! Its a terrible process. And by count of files, photos and videos are the vast majority of the files I care to access!<p>And then its a similar thing with stuff like music, or movies, or all kinds of things. Folder structures are very rigid, things like links are all kinds of fragile and annoying to work with often.<p><i>For the most part</i>, the vast majority of my files I&#x27;d prefer to have them all in some kind of database with tags and be able to query them based on the context of what I&#x27;m doing. Open a photo editor app? Ok, show me photos, probably recent ones first until I put some other search in it. Not just a file browser sitting in a home directory in a folder full of other folders with all kinds of other files that aren&#x27;t even pictures.<p>IMO, for personal files, <i>folders are bad.</i> I don&#x27;t mind a lot of these interfaces that try and hide the underlying file structure, <i>so long as when I need to I can muck about in there as well, if it still exists.</i></div><br/><div id="36348513" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36348513" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">memefrog</span><span>|</span><a href="#36346634">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36347459">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36349529">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36348513">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36348513">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I mostly agree with this.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s &quot;files and folders&quot; that are bad, but a file browser isn&#x27;t the best way of browsing photos.  A file browser is great for documents and you need to have it because you need that &quot;lowest common denominator&quot; browser as a backup or when things go wrong.  But for things like photos what most people probably want is:<p>1. If you plug your SD card&#x2F;camera into your computer, sync all the photos onto your computer and back them up remotely before wiping them from the SD card.
2. If you take photos with your phone, they should automatically be synced to your computer and to a remote backup.
3. When you want to browse your photos, you just go to a &#x27;photo browser&#x27; and browse by tags, date, etc.<p>But one of the problems with this stuff is that those proprietary kinds of databases have a habit of eating your data and being difficult to troubleshoot.  I remember with iTunes it would swallow up music you put into it and hide it away in some internal database somewhere.  I would have much preferred if it had its own browser but that the underlying data were stored in ~&#x2F;Music&#x2F;Artist&#x2F;Album&#x2F;1.Track.mp3, so that if anything went wrong it would be easy to pull all that data out.  I think the way it actually did it was some big store of files with names like ab4f8241def.mp3 and a database mapping artist&#x2F;album&#x2F;etc. to those files.<p>I have all my (legitimately-acquired) TV shows and movies stored across a variety of computers, and then xbmc has media sources that are things like nfs:&#x2F;&#x2F;10.0.0.1&#x2F;tvshows and nfs:&#x2F;&#x2F;10.0.0.2&#x2F;tvshows.  Of course the only way I ever consume any of that data is through... a big aggregating media browser that automatically downloads metadata about my media from TMDB etc.  But it&#x27;s all still stored as &#x2F;media&#x2F;tvshows&#x2F;Silicon\ Valley&#x2F;Season\ 1&#x2F;S01E01.mkv, yknow?

Most developers still use a hypertext document viewer as the interface for most applications. That hypertext document requires more RAM to run than I used to have total in hard drive space (for operating systems that also had hypertext document viewers, that rendered the same visual result as today). All new protocols have to run over port 443; I doubt there&#x27;s been a new protocol port registered with IANA in 5 years. Smart devices have no keyboards and rely on swiping on glass. Everything runs off an internet connection so you can&#x27;t really leave your house or a major city and keep things working, to say nothing of vendor service outages. Android <i>could</i> run regular old Linux and apps and give you a desktop, but it doesn&#x27;t, because we are not holy enough to receive a useful user interface. Samsung had DeX in their phones like 10 years ago but apparently that&#x27;s done for, and good luck finding any modern devices that support the standards needed to do things like output video, audio, ethernet, etc via USB-C. Bluetooth is still total garbage. We still have no audible user interfaces other than shitty cloud-vendor-specific &quot;assistants&quot; (even though I made my own audible user interface 15 years ago for a Car PC with nothing but open source tools). We still pay the same amount for a computer today that I paid for one 20 years ago (although adjusted for inflation I guess those older ones were more expensive). Computers today do exactly the same thing they did 20 years ago: save a document or image or video over a network, display it, print it. The only difference is they now do it in a much slower, more wasteful way. And programming is still a thing. To make a new program, a bunch of humans have to sit around typing out lines of text into a screen, and going through a laborious process to compile and test it all, and it&#x27;s still full of bugs.<p>We could have much better technology. The proof is right there in the article, from 24 years ago. We don&#x27;t have anything better because we just suck at making technology.

All new things run over port 443 and they&#x27;re encrypted with hardware-accelerated encryption schemes, having individual ports for protocols was a pointless mess - there&#x27;s nothing to stop you running something on the wrong port so you can&#x27;t rely on firewall blocking for security.

Literally, I bought it for $1700 in 2003. It doesn&#x27;t run any software better than the $20 raspberri pi I also have. It certainly doesn&#x27;t run software better than the $1200 desktop I built recently - that one can play games on one monitor while web browsing on another (sometimes I&#x27;ll kick of a compile on that machine between matches and neither seems to be hurt too bad by both things running, if I tried that on the old laptop I&#x27;d probably have to call the fire department).<p>Of course my desktop machine doesn&#x27;t actually have a &quot;desktop&quot; (a silly name for a place to hold random icons, a misguided attempt to make computers &#x27;familiar&#x27; for folks who didn&#x27;t quite get it by using a bad metaphor) - it just shows me windows and pops up a pretty menu to choose apps when I press a button. It has 32GB of ram, and even when running games and lots of browser windows and tabs I rarely use more than 16GB of them -- including the fs caches.<p>When the old laptop was current, I would use it for dev, and send compiles off to a distcc cluster. Using that cluster I could get a linux kernel built in a couple hours from scratch - I can do the same on my single desktop machine today, but in way less time (and there&#x27;s a lot more code). Similarly, I would rip CDs and queue up the wav for each track so the cluster could pick them up and encode them as flacc and mp3. I&#x27;d rip a stack of CDs until my drive was mostly full, and go to bed. In the morning the encoding was almost finished. Last time I had a device that could read CDs a few years ago, the bottleneck was reading the CD, and a whole stack of CDs would finish in less time than just ripping would 20 years ago. I have &quot;slow&quot; internet at home, so saving them to some internet drive might make the whole process take the same amount of time as the ripping process in the past.<p>I&#x27;m sorry you&#x27;re disappointed we don&#x27;t have flying cars yet, but it&#x27;s a bit absurdist to claim tech has gotten strictly worse and that the old days were better - because the tech today is literally orders of magnitude better than it was 20 years ago.</div><br/><div id="36348712" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36348712" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">memefrog</span><span>|</span><a href="#36346615">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36347496">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36353443">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36348712">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36348712">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt;Of course my desktop machine doesn&#x27;t actually have a &quot;desktop&quot; (a silly name for a place to hold random icons, a misguided attempt to make computers &#x27;familiar&#x27; for folks who didn&#x27;t quite get it by using a bad metaphor)<p>A desktop full of icons was great.  It was actually very convenient to have your most-used programs and most-accessed directories easily accessible in a grid on your desktop.  Menus are worse.  They&#x27;re linear.  To access something from a menu you need to move your mouse to the corner of your screen, click, wait for the menu to load (this often takes <i>literally 20s</i> on Windows for some reason), then move your mouse to click on a quite-small area of the screen in the menu.  Or you could search in the menu, but for some reason that escapes me this also takes multiple seconds to process on Windows and even when it has processed half the time its search just doesn&#x27;t find what I&#x27;m looking for, and wants to open my search query in a web browser instead.<p>On a desktop, you have things arrayed out on a grid. If your mouse is in the middle of the screen, then it&#x27;s in a sense O(sqrt(n)) time to get to something on a grid.  Each icon can be larger (easier to click on) because they&#x27;re not constrained to all be in a linear menu.  And because you can choose the order they appear in, it&#x27;s easy muscle memory to just click the same icon in the same spot every time.<p>Desktops were great.  I really hate this current trend of denigrating &quot;files&quot; and &quot;folders&quot; and &quot;desktops&quot; because their <i>names</i> are skeuomorphic.  I blame Apple for this.  They made such a big thing about removing the skeuomorphism from their notes app and replacing everything with bland samey flat design.  People seem to have latched onto that and decided that anything remotely skeuomorphic must automatically be bad.  Nobody is actually thinking about the top of their desk when they see a computer desktop.  Maybe they did in the 1990s but not today.  It&#x27;s just a convenient grid of shortcuts to applications, files, and folders.</div><br/><div id="36348870" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36348870" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">sophacles</span><span>|</span><a href="#36346615">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36348712">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36353443">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36348870">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36348870">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Why would i use a mouse to open apps and navigate a menu?

It all happens in under a second (except launching chrome, but that&#x27;s mostly chrome not my system).<p>Im not denigrating files and folders. Im not upset that desktop is the name, its fitting for the metaphor they were going for, its just a silly use of my screen - most of the time the &quot;desktop&quot; should be under actually useful windows that are doing actual useful work.

But most people find using the mouse more intuitive than the keyboard.<p>I think it&#x27;s actually quite good that you get back to the desktop by clicking the &#x27;minimise everything&#x27; button.  It reduces cognitive load to switch tasks by making everything currently open &quot;go away&quot; and then starting a new task, rather than just loading up every new task on top of the old one.  It&#x27;s like opening a new window for a new task vs just opening 500 tabs in one window.  Better yet are systems with multiple desktops where you start a new activity (&quot;Okay checking my emails is done, time to do some budgeting&quot;) by going to a new desktop and then clicking Excel or GnuCash or whatever.<p>The desktop is for most people just a generic collection of random stuff.  That seems chaotic and bad and messy, but I think it&#x27;s actually really powerful.  It&#x27;s like the filesystem.  Probably for every type of document there is a better way to browse it.  Photos are best browsed in a photo browser.  Videos in a video browser.  Documents in a document browser.  But a traditional file browser is the best <i>generic</i> browser of things.  Similarly, an overlay application launcher is probably better for quickly starting a program, and a &#x27;recent files&#x27; launcher might be better for that, and a &#x27;favourite folders&#x27; thing might be better for that, etc. etc.  But in practice people tend towards a kind of &#x27;managed chaos&#x27; that intentionally-designed systems don&#x27;t handle very well.  It&#x27;s the backup, the default, the catchall.  Every system needs something like that.  That&#x27;s what your desktop ends up being.<p>Go to an office.  Is everything filed perfectly?  No, most stuff is and then there&#x27;s always, inevitably, a &#x27;miscellaneous&#x27; section.  Everyone has that little jar with random screws and twist-ties and rubber bands and those little tags things that go around bread bags when they&#x27;re twisted and a couple of coins.  Everyone has that drawer which has USB cables and old phones and permanent markers and foreign coins from that time you went overseas.

When the volunteers tire of keeping their mini-distros up to date (and they often do, given enough time), owners of older devices like these are left with just a few options: not care about updates (and possible security issues), try to do the work of applying updates themselves, or abandoning the platform. I don&#x27;t see the attraction, except for those who enjoy the challenge of updating things themselves.<p>Another option is NetBSD, which doesn&#x27;t eject platforms because they&#x27;re not popular. It&#x27;s one thing if the toolchain requires extensive work, like VAX or ns32k, but if there&#x27;s enough interest, it happens.
