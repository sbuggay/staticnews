They work and are relatively bug-free (the horrible one in particular is battle-tested). I didn&#x27;t have much to do to run them on PHP 8.2.

By Percy Bysshe Shelley<p><pre><code>  I met a traveller from an antique land,
  Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
  Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,
  Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
  And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
  Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
  Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
  The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;
  And on the pedestal, these words appear:
  My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;
  Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!
  Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
  Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare
  The lone and level sands stretch far away.”</code></pre></div><br/><div id="35959255" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35959255" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tsukikage</span><span>|</span><a href="#35958909">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35957402">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35959255">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35959255">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The Palace - Rudyard Kipling<p><pre><code>    When I was a King and a Mason - a Master proven and skilled 
    I cleared me ground for a Palace such as a King should build. 
    I decreed and dug down to my levels. Presently under the silt 
    I came on the wreck of a Palace such as a King had built.  

    There was no worth in the fashion - there was no wit in the plan - 
    Hither and thither, aimless, the ruined footings ran - 
    Masonry, brute, mishandled, but carven on every stone: 
    &quot;After me cometh a Builder. Tell him I too have known.   

    Swift to my use in the trenches, where my well-planned ground-works grew, 
    I  tumbled his quoins and his ashlars, and cut and reset them anew. 
    Lime I milled of his marbles; burned it slacked it, and spread; 
    Taking and leaving at pleasure the gifts of the humble dead.  

    Yet I despised not nor gloried; yet, as we wrenched them apart, 
    I read in the razed foundations the heart of that builder’s heart. 
    As he had written and pleaded, so did I understand 
    The form of the dream he had followed in the face of the thing he had planned. 
      
         

    When I was a King and a Mason, in the open noon of my pride, 
    They sent me a Word from the Darkness. They whispered and called me aside.
    They said - &quot;The end is forbidden.&quot; They said - &quot;Thy use is fulfilled. 
    &quot;Thy Palace shall stand as that other’s - the spoil of a King who shall build.&quot;

    I called my men from my trenches, my quarries my wharves and my sheers. 
    All I had wrought I abandoned to the faith of the faithless years. 
    Only I cut on the timber - only I carved on the stone:
    &quot;After me cometh a Builder. Tell him, I too have known.&quot;</code></pre></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="35957402" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35957402" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">FrustratedMonky</span><span>|</span><a href="#35958909">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35957994">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35957402">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35957402">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Everyone one that has counter examples thinking they prove the opposite, are just not waiting long enough.

Or phrased another way, becoming normal. The training process humans go through leads to a lot of weird biases, just like how RLHF contributes to models getting bad ideas as well as good.<p>For example, you spend years in school being instructed as efficiently as possible in the one right way to do things that was already discovered. You are only rarely or never shown the messy process of trial and error needed to get there, and many really big errors are hardly covered at all (the history of communism didn&#x27;t even get a look-in when I was at school!).<p>Another: you&#x27;re instructed near exclusively by specialists, who are definitionally always right (if you argue with the teacher, you lose).<p>Yet another: as you progress through the system, you&#x27;re rewarded as the ideas you handle get more complex. You aren&#x27;t rewarded for simplicity. You are also rewarded for bullshitting, because just like RLHF, exams don&#x27;t award points for saying &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; but they can award points for a lucky guess.<p>These sorts of systems inevitably lead to an assumption that progress is linear, mistakes rare, complexity intrinsically has value, that expertise is nearly infallible, that guessing is OK if you don&#x27;t know and the situation seems important etc. The longer one spends in education the further from reality these intuitions become, until you reach academia and become a public intellectual who produces the most complex&#x2F;radical ideas possible based on educated guessing and then ignores whether they work or not.<p>Life outside the training environment eventually starts to correct these false ideas. You see how many things are tried that fail, how nuanced and ambiguous the value of ideas really is, how complexity blows up in people&#x27;s faces due to problems they didn&#x27;t anticipate and so on. You start to value incrementalism, evolutionary processes, systems that gather and aggregate the wisdom of the crowds. You become less impressed with ivory tower intellectuals who think they got it all figured out in advance on a blackboard. You become conservative, and end up railing against the young radicals who have some bright idea for reshaping society by force.</div><br/><div id="35959222" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35959222" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">TRiG_Ireland</span><span>|</span><a href="#35957402">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35958521">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35958645">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35959222">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35959222">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Well, becoming small-c conservative, to a certain extent, is probably fairly normal, though perhaps not inevitable.

The knowledgeable coworker should be aware that a writable object implements the Write trait, and know, or find out, the signature of the Write::write() method. Even fully generic, a function accepting a connection and returning the result of writing a block of data is not too gnarly:<p><pre><code>    use std::io::{self, Write};

No unwraps, no clones. Because they&#x27;re not necessary here. But <i>someone</i> has to know the language and the idioms.

The new&#x27;ed Writer is a struct; why is there a need to get a reference to it?  Why is data being clone() and then immediately de-referenced to create a copy of the clone?<p>A normal writer API would look like one of the variations:<p><pre><code>    Writer&lt;T&gt;::new(&amp;connection).write(&amp;data)
    Writer&lt;T&gt;::new(&amp;mut connection).write(&amp;data)  &#x2F;&#x2F; if conn needs changes.

It&#x27;s rare to unwrap(), which can cause a crash at runtime, but to handle the result.  E.g. to write more data if the previous write is successful.<p><pre><code>    let mut writer = Writer&lt;T&gt;::new(&amp;connection);
    let mut written_len = 0;
    written_len += writer.write(&amp;data1)?  &#x2F;&#x2F; ? returns the err if it&#x27;s Err
    written_len += writer.write(&amp;data2)?  &#x2F;&#x2F; or unwrap the result value
    written_len += writer.write(&amp;data3)?

Occasionally it is useful during debugging performance problems in kernels.<p>* My knowledge of distributed systems (stuff like leader election, distributed and centralised algorithms) is 15 years old. It is still very relevant to understand both existing systems and to evaluate new systems.<p>It is crucial to distinguish the knowledge that stands the test of time from the fleeting trends.
