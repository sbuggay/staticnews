It’s like you’re in a continuous abusive relationship with your own democracy.<p>My wife and I just had twins, and while it went fine they needed CPAP to help their lungs develop fully because they were born with a c-section. Which put them in the children’s intensive care unit for around 12 hours and afterward we lived for 7 days in the specialised ward for children with troubled births. And it cost us around $100 because the lodging for spouses isn’t free for the first 3 days(3 meals a day + fruits and cake and all sorts of drinkable stuff that I don’t know the English names for… mostly concentrated fruit you mix with water).<p>Now, I do pay around 57% in taxes on everything I earn above $90k and 39% before that (my wife pays 37% since she doesn’t earn above $90k). But I do sort of “cheat” the system by investing 14% of my pay before taxes into methods that will let me pay 25% in taxes on another $10k a year, and some that goes directly into my children’s investments. Anyway, that is what we pay for everyone to have this opportunity in our country.<p>I’m not going to pretend our system is perfect. Like, I have a private health insurance through my job which led me skip a two year wait time when I was diagnosed with  bipolar type2 after having some issues with stress. And that’s obviously not available to everyone, and a two year wait period is obviously terrible for people who can’t turn to the private sector. So everything isn’t perfect.<p>But when you then read about how US citizens pay ridiculous amount of money to have children… when they live in a nation which is significantly richer than ours… it just baffles the mind.<p>Similarly we have about 9 months of maternity leave. 2 months of which are with full pay for my wife, and 14 weeks are with full pay for me (I have really terms through my work often it’s only 2-4 weeks for spouses). But even when you aren’t on full pay, you’re still getting around $5k a month from the government. You’re also paid around $1k per child every 3 months for the first couple of years of their lives (something which should probably be limited by income if we’re honest since people like us need it a lot less than most Danes). My wife transferred some of her maternity leave and was decades sick for the first two months, so I’m getting around 30 weeks of paternity leave which does mean a significant decrease in income this year, but then you look at how US citizens basically have no paid leave and again… it’s just so weird.<p>And you’ve chosen this yourselves. I know it’s not as easy as that, but you are a democracy and you do elect your leaders and a huge part of you are basically wage slaves. I know a lot of HN’ers are likely to also have good terms, it comes with our line or work, but as a whole… I mean, just why?</div><br/><div id="39498886" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39498886" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ponector</span><span>|</span><a href="#39498515">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39498764">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39498850">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39498886">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39498886">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In Poland you pay ~30% of your salary as income and social taxes.<p>If employed, woman has free access to public health system, with huge waiting lists, as you mentioned in your case.<p>When getting pregnant, woman can go into full paid sick leave untill the delivery day.

I was friends for a time with a Canadian woman who used to openly hate on America and one of her criticisms was we have apparently a weirdly high percentage of citizens who have served in the military.<p>So I sometimes wonder how many American children get born while one of their parents is in service. And I spent years trying to figure out how to explain to other Americans what military life and military compensation is like and I eventually gave up. Civilian jobs have relatively high pay and few benefits. Military jobs have relatively low pay but high benefits and it&#x27;s an apples to oranges comparison and I know when I was a military wife, anyone who wasn&#x27;t making a career of it seemed to be trying to have all the kids they planned to ever have before leaving service because it&#x27;s so cheap to have a kid while in service.<p>I desperately wish America would fix some of its problems. But I genuinely wonder just how bad it really is when I never see mention of details like that and when I have looked for data on just how many Americans get some portion of their medical care covered as military dependents for some portion of their life, I have been unable to turn up stats. So I don&#x27;t know what to conclude, honestly.<p>But if I cannot figure it out as an American, my guess is your opinions amount to prejudice, not informed analysis. And although I know why so many people in the world have opinions about the US -- because the US is very influential, so it impacts them -- I don&#x27;t run around telling other countries how to fix their social problems and it bugs me that so many foreigners feel they know what is best for us, often without ever having lived here.</div><br/><div id="39499000" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39499000" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">usea</span><span>|</span><a href="#39498515">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39498850">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39498750">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39499000">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39499000">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As a first approximation from a quick google search, approximately 2.75% of US children are born to one or more parents who are in the military.
