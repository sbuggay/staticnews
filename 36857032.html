The attacker manufactures a device, such as a smartphone, generates a keypair for it, stores it on an HSM on the device (generally called a &quot;trusted enclave&quot;), and signs the public key of the keypair with a master key<p>2. The device runs the attacker&#x27;s software and is designed so that whenever non-attacker software is run with elevated privileges, the HSM is informed of that fact in a way that can&#x27;t be reset without rebooting (and starting again with the attacker&#x27;s software). For instance, the device might use a verified boot scheme, send the key the OS is signed with to the HSM in a way that is unchangeable until reboot, and it might employ hardening like having the CPU encrypt RAM or apply an HMAC to RAM<p>3. The HSM produces signatures of messages that contain statements that the device is running the attacker&#x27;s software, plus whatever the attacker&#x27;s software wants to communicate and it won&#x27;t produce them if it&#x27;s running software of the user&#x27;s choice as opposed to the attacker&#x27;s software as established above. It also includes the signature of its public key with the master keypair, allowing accomplices to check that the device is indeed not under the user&#x27;s control, but rather under the control of someone they trust to effectively limit the user&#x27;s freedom<p>4. Optionally, that attestation is passed through the attacker&#x27;s servers, which check it and return another attestation signed by themselves, allowing to anonymize the device and apply arbitrary other criteria<p>5. Conniving third parties can thus use this scheme to ensure that they are interacting with a device running the attacker&#x27;s software, and thus that the device is restricting the user behavior as the attacker specifies. For instance, it can ensure that the device is running the accomplice&#x27;s code unmodified, preventing the user from being able to run software of their choice, and it can ensure that the user is using device as desired by the attacker and their accomplices.<p>This attack is already running against Android smartphone users (orchestrated by Google, in the form of SafetyNet and the Play Integrity API) and iOS smartphone users (orchestrated by Apple) and this extends the attack to the web.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36857556" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36857556" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">eganist</span><span>|</span><a href="#36859465">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36858172">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36857556">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36857556">[41 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Expected, but meaningless if we can&#x27;t drive people towards Firefox and away from Chromium products.

Building trust with advertising clients be treating them with respect, honesty and transparency. If your clients don&#x27;t trust your advertising network and were demanding assurances in the form of WEI and similar proposals, surely it&#x27;s obvious there are bigger problems. The advertising client would likely have dropped the advertising network long ago but can&#x27;t due to monopolies existing.<p>2. Advertising networks undergo independent audits (results available to clients) and become more transparent to clients in how their advertising spend is being used.<p>3. Advertising clients survey users at checkout to ask whether they found the product&#x2F;service from an advert, or whether they recall seeing an advertising campaign and where they remember seeing it.<p>4. Advertising clients host advertisements at ads.company.example (in a few highly restricted formats) so they can keep track of impressions themselves.<p>5. (still a bad idea, based on user surveys, but one which Google et al should have considered for minimisation of data collection and privacy impact) Browsers collect advertising metrics during use and when a user makes a transaction at an online store, the online store asks the user (via the browser) for permission to obtain those saved advertising metrics to provide only to the online store. Users can review the entirety of information sent to the online store before it is sent. Advertising networks don&#x27;t have a need to access browsing history for everyone on the Internet in real time.<p>6. Online stores and similar continue to rotate their marketing spend through various advertising networks and marketing campaigns, checking their own metrics to see if advertising campaigns have been having an impact. Campaigns could include marketing using the Internet but outside the reach of Google et al such as use of campaign-specific coupons and products marketed through product review websites, referral schemes, influencers, etc.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36858573" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36858573" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">throw_a_grenade</span><span>|</span><a href="#36858172">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36858434">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36859280">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36858929">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36858573">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36858573">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Attribution is necessary for advertising to work at all.<p>Yes, and since &quot;attribution&quot; as defined here is incompatible with user&#x27;s privacy (which is a human right), therefore advertising should fail.

From 10,000 feet in the sky, there&#x27;s zero difference between, say, someone who installed modified software on their phone to protect their privacy and someone who was tricked into installing malware[0].

Anticheat in games is treated as at least beneficial to honest users, but it can still be user hostile[1].

The underlying power dynamic of attestation means that websites can just demand attestors ban screen readers, in the same way that ebook DRM already does.<p>[0] Casual reminder that Louis Rossman was harassed by the GrapheneOS developer for agreeing with someone that the developer asserted had harassed them.
