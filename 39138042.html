It&#x27;s a serious start and they&#x27;ve already written a viewer. In fact, the article itself is displayed in a browser-based wasm port of the viewer (and looks good!).<p>One issue is how precisely EPUB, which is really XHTML, can reproduce layout. What are the possibilities here? The OP&#x27;s standard is that the document will look &quot;reasonable&quot;. The imply that HTML would need new layout capabilities to match PDF, at least for line breaking:<p><i>There&#x27;s two ways to make progress here. One is for browsers to provide more typography tools. Allegedly, text-wrap: pretty is supposed to help, but in my brief testing it doesn&#x27;t seem to improve line-break quality. The other way is to pre-calculate line breaks, which would only work for fixed-layout renditions.</i><p>Also, though the author mentions annotations, I don&#x27;t see how they intend to implement them.</div><br/><div id="39139629" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39139629" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">joshjob42</span><span>|</span><a href="#39139181">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39140001">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39139629">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39139629">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The author discusses fixed layout epubs. Effectively, the epub can give a default pagination, line-breaks, font, font size, page size, and positioning for images etc., making it render identically on everything (one might optionally omit pagination if opening in a browser but keep everything else). This can be done already in epub3. But that&#x27;s not ideal, because then it doesn&#x27;t look good anymore on a phone, etc. Depending on the reader though, you could override the default, but then you have to hope that your reader does a good job of making a nice document. An alternative is for the epub to specify multiple renderings, for various common screen types.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is unreasonable as a solution. By all means let&#x27;s try to get a smart reader, but letting people create defaults for their documents that can be overridden if desired by the user is a good middle ground.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39140001" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39140001" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zozbot234</span><span>|</span><a href="#39139181">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39139629">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39140201">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39140001">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39140001">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Doesn&#x27;t CSS support layout capabilities for paged media out of the box?

This is not hypothetical, either; as of the time of writing, Google Doc&#x27;s EPUB exporter will emit CSS that will @include external Google Fonts files.
