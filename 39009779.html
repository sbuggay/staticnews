How they would be used was certainly debated, but there was a clear and well-explained proposal for every step of their creation, which could be tested and falsified if needed.

Should we ban a linear regression while we&#x27;re at it?<p>It would be great to see some evidence that this risk is real. All I&#x27;ve witnessed so far was scaremongering posts from apparatchicks of all shapes and colors, many of whom have either a vested interest in restricting AI research by others (but not by them, because they are safe and responsible and harmless), or established a lucrative paper-pushing, shoulder-rubbing career around &#x27;AI safety&#x27; - and thus are strongly incentivised to double down on that.<p>A security org in a large company will keep tightening the screws until everything halts; a transport security agency, given free reigh, would strip everyone naked and administer a couple of profilactic kicks for a good measure - and so on. That&#x27;s just the nature of it - organisations do what they do to maintain themselves. It is critical to keep these things on a leash. Similarly, an AI Safety org must proseletyse excistential risks of AI - because a lack of evidence of such is an existential risk for themselves.<p>A real risk, which we do have evidence for, is that LLMs might disrupt knowledge-based economy and threaten many key professions - but how is this conceptually different from any technological revolution? Perhaps in a hundred years lawyers, radiologists, and, indeed, software developers, will find themselves in the bin of history - together with flint chippers, chariot benders, drakkar berserkers and so forth.
