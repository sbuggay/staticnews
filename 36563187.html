In practice, (a) is never true, and (b) is no longer true because everyone is running apps inside containers inside shared VMs. In the modern application&#x2F;server environment, no user level process has accurate information about the total state of the machine, only the kernel (or hypervisor) does and it&#x27;s an exercise in futility to try to manage paging etc at the user level.<p>As Dr. Michael Stonebraker put it: The Traditional RDBMS Wisdom is (Almost Certainly) All Wrong. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slideshot.epfl.ch&#x2F;play&#x2F;suri_stonebraker" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slideshot.epfl.ch&#x2F;play&#x2F;suri_stonebraker</a> (See the slide at 21:25 into the video). Modern DBMSs spend 96% of their time managing buffers and locks, and only 4% doing actual useful work for the caller.<p>Granted, even using mmap you still need to know wtf you&#x27;re doing. MongoDB&#x27;s original mmap backing store was a poster child for Doing It Wrong, getting all of the reliability problems and none of the performance benefits. LMDB is an example of doing it right: perfect crash-proof reliability, and perfect linear read scalability across arbitrarily many CPUs with zero-copy reads and no wasted effort, and a hot code path that fits into a CPU&#x27;s 32KB L1 instruction cache.</div><br/><div id="36565886" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36565886" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">crabbone</span><span>|</span><a href="#36564309">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36565504">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36565886">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36565886">[11 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; your DBMS is the only process running on a machine.

In fact, if I had to compare, I&#x27;d go with storage people being the more experienced &#x2F; knowledgeable ones.  They have a highly competitive environment, which requires a lot more understanding and inventiveness to succeed, whereas kernel programmers proper don&#x27;t compete -- Linux won many years ago.  Kernel programmers who deal with stuff like drivers or various &quot;extensions&quot; are, largely, in the same group as storage (often time literally the same people).<p>As for &quot;single process&quot; argument... well, if you run a database inside an OS, then, obviously, that will never happen as OS has its own processes to run.  But, if you ignore that -- no DBA worth their salt would put database in the environment where it has to share resources with applications.  People who do that are, probably, Web developers who don&#x27;t have high expectations from their database anyways and would have no idea how to configure &#x2F; tune it for high performance, so, it doesn&#x27;t matter how they run it, they aren&#x27;t the target audience -- they are light years behind on what&#x27;s possible to achieve with their resources.<p>This has nothing to do with mmap though. mmap shouldn&#x27;t be used for storage applications for other reasons. mmap doesn&#x27;t allow their users to precisely control the persistence aspect... which is kind of the central point of databases.  So, it&#x27;s a mostly worthless tool in that context.

 the time of power loss.&quot;<p><pre><code>  From the specs on page 15, the data transfer rate to&#x2F;from the platters is
 1.25MB&#x2F;sec, so the time to write one full sector is 0.4096ms; the time to
 write the leading 128 bytes of the sector is thus 1&#x2F;4 of that: 0.10ms. You
 would have to be very very unlucky to have a power failure hit the drive

 not an issue.

No matter how you choose to manage workloads, ultimately you are responsible for tuning and optimization.<p>If you&#x27;re not in control of the system, and thus kubelet, obviously your hands are tied. I&#x27;m not sure anyone is suggesting that for a serious workload.<p>Now to dispell your myths:<p>1. You can assign dedicated storage devices to your database. Outside of mount operations you&#x27;re not going to see much alien fsync activity. This is paranoid.<p>2. You can pin kubelet CPU cores. You can ensure exclusive access to the remaining ones. There are a number of advanced techniques that are not at all necessary if you want to be a control freak, such as creating your own cgroups. This isn&#x27;t &quot;outside&quot; of the runtime. Kubernetes is designed to conform to your managed cgroups. That&#x27;s the whole point. RTFM.<p>3. The general theme of your complaint has nothing to do with kubernetes. There&#x27;s no beating a dedicated NIC and even network fabric. Some cloud providers even allow you to multi-NIC out of the box so this is pretty solvable. Also, like, the dumbest QoS rules can drastically minimize this problem generally. Who cares.<p>4. Nah. RTFM. This is total FUD.<p>5.a. I don&#x27;t understand. Are you sharing resources on the node or not? If you&#x27;re not, then swap works fine. If you are, then this smells like cognitive dissonance and maybe listen to your own advice, but also swap is still very doable. It&#x27;s just disk. swapon to your heart&#x27;s content. But also swap is almost entirely dumb these days. Are you suggesting swapping to your primary IO device? Come on. More FUD.<p>5.b. OOM killer does what it wants. What&#x27;s a better alternative that integrates &quot;well&quot; with the OOM killer? Do you even understand how resource limits work? The OOM killer is only ever a problem if you either do not configure your workload properly (true regardless of execution environment) or you run out of actual memory.<p>Bottom line: come down off your high horse and acknowledge that dedicated resources and kernel tuning is the secret to extreme high performance. I don&#x27;t care how you&#x27;re orchestrating your workloads, the best practices are essentially universal.<p>And to be clear, I&#x27;m not recommending using Kubernetes to run a high performance database but it&#x27;s not really any worse (today) than alternatives.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s written for Web developers. To make things appear simpler for them, while sacrificing a lot of resources and hiding a lot of actual complexity... which is impossible to hide, and which, in an even of failure will come to bite you.<p>What planet are you currently on? This makes no sense. It&#x27;s a set of abstractions and patterns, the intent isn&#x27;t to hide the complexity but to make it manageable at scale. I&#x27;d argue it succeeds at that.<p>Seriously, what is the alternative runtime you&#x27;d prefer here? systemd? hand rolled bash scripts? puppet and ansible? All of the above??</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36565248" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36565248" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">danappelxx</span><span>|</span><a href="#36564309">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36565076">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36566151">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36565981">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36565248">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36565248">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I’ll assume the worst case:<p>- lots of containers running on a single host<p>- containers are each isolated in a VM (aka virtualized)<p>- workloads are not homogenous and change often (your neighbor today may not be your neighbor tomorrow)<p>I believe these are fair assumptions if you’re running on generic infrastructure with kubernetes.<p>In this setup, my concerns are pretty much noisy neighbors + throttling.

Storage density is massively important for both workload scalability and economic efficiency. Low storage density means buying a ton of server hardware that sits idle under max load and vastly larger clusters than would otherwise be necessary, which have their own costs.<p>When your database is sufficiently large, backup and restore often isn’t even a technical possibility so that requirement is a red herring. The kinds of workloads that can be recovered from backup at that scale on a single server, and some can, benefit massively from the economics of running it on a single server. A solution that has 10x the AWS bill for the same workload performance doesn’t get chosen.<p>At scale, hardware footprint economics is one of the central business decision drivers. Data isn’t getting smaller.

- timeseries logging where you are usually reading infrequently but writing very much in a denormalized format so joins aren&#x27;t as critical<p>For general CRUD, ACID is important though.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36564492" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36564492" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cratermoon</span><span>|</span><a href="#36563633">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36563928">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36567009">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36566784">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36564492">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36564492">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Did you ever read Pat Helland&#x27;s article, &quot;Life Beyond Distributed Transactions: An apostate’s opinion&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.acm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;3012426.3025012" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.acm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;3012426.3025012</a>? &quot;This article explores and names some of the practical approaches used in the implementation of large-scale mission-critical applications in a world that rejects distributed transactions.&quot;</div><br/><div id="36564889" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36564889" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wood_spirit</span><span>|</span><a href="#36563633">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36564492">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36566784">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36564889">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36564889">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">No I haven’t.

This means (a) POSIX is violated (IMO) and (b) what should be a minor fault to enable writes turns into an actual metadata write, which can cause actual synchronous IO.<p>I have an ancient patch set to fix this, but I never got it all the way into upstream Linux.<p>What you <i>can</i> do is mmap a file on a tmpfs as long as you trust yourself to have some other reliable process handle the data even if your application terminates abnormally. This is awkward with a container solution if you need to survive termination of the entire container.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36566340" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36566340" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">whartung</span><span>|</span><a href="#36563712">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36563848">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36563929">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36564023">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36566340">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36566340">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It’s useful in a world of several processes sharing things.
