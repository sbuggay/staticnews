I&#x27;ve been thinking about it for a long time.<p>I like the idea of proof of personhood, and proof of location. These are both concepts that I have explored extensively. I looked at retina scans, and found it they&#x27;re both not unique enough, and not secure enough to act as a basis for a currency.<p>My proof of location was based on the 500 mile email story. Many millions of round trips between two devices could allow someone to prove on a blockchain that two secret keys were stored arbitrarily close to one another for some amount of time.<p>The paper mentions key signing parties which I believe must be part of any web of trust that proves personhood. Proving uniqueness is more difficult. There&#x27;s nothing that would stop me from having several different identities verified at different key signing parties, then using those to generate even more.<p>Using genealogy seems to be the only way to truly verify a unique identity if the system becomes widespread enough that parents often verify their children at birth. Then the age of the identity matches the age of the individual.<p>Farther into the future, the possibility of creating multiple copies of myself makes it much more difficult to tie an identity to a particular group of cells. There&#x27;s nothing truly unique about a copy, especially if we have the ability to change our DNA.<p>Philosophically, I started to wonder if there&#x27;s anything particularly special about any arrangement of cells. Maybe we should all just do our best, share resources, and create a society where abundance makes keeping track of all this stuff unnecessary.</div><br/><div id="37097810" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37097810" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">magic_hamster</span><span>|</span><a href="#37097719">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37094151">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37097810">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37097810">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Philosophically, I started to wonder if there&#x27;s anything particularly special about any arrangement of cells. Maybe we should all just do our best, share resources, and create a society where abundance makes keeping track of all this stuff unnecessary.<p>We are an arrangement of cells betrayed by the human character. If all we wanted was to live leisurely this could have been easily achieved after the industrial revolution. But it&#x27;s our nature to be ambitious, to achieve things, to want more, to compete, to be greedy and 1up each other. Most people are never satisfied regardless of how big their house is or what they do for a living. So I don&#x27;t think an idle society of abundance can exist as long as people are competing for the largest piece of the pie.</div><br/><div id="37098123" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37098123" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">wcerfgba</span><span>|</span><a href="#37097719">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37097810">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37094151">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37098123">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37098123">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Or perhaps its a small minority of people who have access to vast wealth and control through a combination of luck, ruthlessness, and glitches in our social, economic, and political systems, who then maintain their power by refusing to makes those systems more equitable.

And they should really be enforcing rate limits and punishing abusive behavior whether the user clicked a button in a browser or a script did.<p>These type of things are not rooted in a fundamental understanding of identity, they&#x27;re sloppy stop-gaps. Despite all its faults, this is one of the reasons I&#x27;m super excited about WebAuthN. At least is make common the idea that an identity is a cryptographic secret and not a &quot;possession of an email and phone&quot;. We really really need to dig out of this &quot;email address identifies you&quot; hole.<p>Anyway it&#x27;s exciting to see people discuss the topic more formally. It gives me hope that we can ultimately get to a better understanding of digital identity and not be trying to solve impossible problems by chasing an impossibly perfect solution that verifies all 3 tenets that actually doesn&#x27;t exist and making a big mess of things because nobody stopped to ask or understand the scope of what we <i>should</i> be trying to do.<p>Ultimately identity should be empowering not oppressive. And right now it feels more like services oppress people into all sorts of weird requirements like having an email, getting a phone verification code, running software on a device that has an integrity attestation framework, etc. rather than trust them and punish bad behavior.<p>I want my government (and web services, but especially my government) to trust me and punish bad behavior, not treat me like an untrusted bot that needs to be managed and continuously verified.</div><br/><div id="37096530" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37096530" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">saurik</span><span>|</span><a href="#37094151">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37094732">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37096530">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37096530">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; At least is make common the idea that an identity is a cryptographic secret and not a &quot;possession of an email and phone&quot;.
