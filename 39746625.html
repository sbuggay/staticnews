There is a well-defined standard protocol for basic SPI mode, so virtually all chips will respond to the same read command for simple slow byte-by-byte reading. The only thing left to try is the four SPI modes (Does clock idle high or low? Do we transfer on the full pulse, or on the half pulse?) - hardware often even supports two of them, and there&#x27;s only one set which actually makes sense.<p>QSPI, on the other hand, is more of a wild-west. You need to run a bunch of chip-specific commands to enter QSPI mode, and there are quite a few possible variations for QSPI read commands, not to mention a lot of different timing requirements. Trying out all of them isn&#x27;t really possible, hence the chip-specific boot2 segment.<p>Staying in SPI mode isn&#x27;t really viable either because the application code is stored in the flash chip. To give an example, jumping to a random instruction would incur a 1280 ns read with a W25Q80BW flash chip operating in SPI mode (realistically x10 due to a lower safe clock frequency), whereas QSPI mode can reliably do that in as little as 125 ns. With the RP2040 running at 133MHz a 16-cycle delay for a random jump or a read from a data block is not too bad, but a 170 or even 1700-cycle delay is just way too much.</div><br/><div id="39752499" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39752499" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mips_r4300i</span><span>|</span><a href="#39748008">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39748289">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39752499">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39752499">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Great info, and now some chips are supporting Octo-SPI which is even more vendor dependent.

I was able to write blinky with few dozens of assembly instructions for STM32. I spent like month reading about SPI, QSPI, flash chips and still was not able to understand how to proceed with RP2040 other than copy&amp;paste their &quot;bootloader&quot; as an opaque blob.<p>May be I&#x27;m weird, but for me RP2040 was terrible chip for learning ARM. STM32 on the other hand just worked and I gradually learned to blink the chip, to write linker script, to write UART, to use C, to use CMSIS and so on. In the end I was able to write a commercial firmware with it.<p>I understand that if I would just use their SDK with cmake, that wouldn&#x27;t be a problem, but I&#x27;m not going to use their SDK.

It&#x27;s much easier to start simple, with just an assembler and may be linker. And a chip for beginners must not require those complex initialization procedures.<p>This chip is also incredibly complex with its two cores and PIO cores. It&#x27;s absolutely cool thing, but it&#x27;s absolutely not for beginners, it&#x27;s for experienced engineers. I&#x27;d prefer something simple, like STM32, with built-in flash, but with proper documentation and without any compromises. Like flexible voltage source, on-board programmer, plenty of hardware blocks, not cheap price (because who cares if chip cost is $1 or $10 for hobby).<p>RP2040 documentation is superb, I must admit.

STM32 on the other hand just worked<p>My experience was opposite of yours. I found RP2040 refreshing compared to the complexity of dealing with proprietary toolchains that other devices required for me to start working with their chips. Nearly every part of RP2040 was documented in great detail and usable exclusively with the tools I could find in Arch Linux repo (when using Linux) and Homebrew (when using Mac). I could drop down to assembly or move up to C++, or even Rust or Python depending on whether I wanted to tool around or just get things done.<p>Even more impressive was that I was able to use debugger with another RP2040 Pico acting as SWD debug probe (Google Picoprobe) which again worked the same across Mac and Linux with the software I already had (gdb) and saved me from buying yet another piece of JTAG hardware with questionable software support.<p>Oh, and <i>every</i> single software with RP2040, including UF2 boot-rom, second stage bootloader and examples are on Github, which allowed me to go as deep as I wanted and more importantly, just get on with what I needed to do when I wanted things to just work.<p>I&#x27;ve worked with uC on and off, but never I have worked with a uC that just worked with just worked with tools I already had. I now work exclusively with RP2040, even when I find other chips much more capable (ESP32 in this case). RP2040 allows me to futz around as long as I want, as deep or shallow as I have time on hand, plus when I stop futzing around, it allows me to just flash new ROM over USB and get on do what I &#x2F;need&#x2F; to do.<p>Oh.. and I just <i>love</i> the USB mass-storage mode – no more custom flasher tools, just `cp blah.uf2 &#x2F;mnt&#x2F;RP2040&#x2F;` and off I go. I can smoke it, but I can&#x27;t brick it!
