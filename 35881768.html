He was Prime Minister of Pakistan in 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine.  He refused to take sides in the conflict, despite pressure by the US.  In March of 2022, Pakistan&#x27;s Ambassador to the US, Asad Majeed Khan (no relation), sent a letter to the PTI government from his post in Washington DC saying that the US government was  threatening to withdraw financial aid to Pakistan (at least $32 billion over the last 20 years) if they didn&#x27;t get rid of Khan (denied by the US government).  Days later Khan was removed as Prime Minister by a &quot;no confidence&quot; vote.  Since then, corruption charges have been filed again Khan and thousands of his supporters have been surrounding Khan&#x27;s home and repelling attempts by the government and the army to arrest him (until now).  Now the situation is extremely volatile as the extremely unpopular government, seen as deeply corrupt by the vast majority of Pakistanis (corruption is endemic there), has arrested the most popular politician in the country on charges of corruption.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="35885023" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35885023" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">chmike</span><span>|</span><a href="#35882433">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35881981">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35885023">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35885023">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Note: My comment is about communication restrictions and not about Imran Khan or Pakistan.<p>Restricting communication does indeed introduce a bias in information that people may get and thus the opinion they may forge.

Double spend attacks have been used in some scams already where the payment system didn&#x27;t wait for the payment to make it to what becomes the &quot;right&quot; chain (validation takes up to 1½ hours with Bitcoin, depending on how many blocks the payment provider waits before assuming the transaction succeeded).<p>You don&#x27;t need to take down the entire internet to sabotage cryptocurrency either. Many cryptocurrencies rely on a few key validation servers as running and processing the entire block chain all the time becomes very resource intensive as crypto gains popularity. A strategic attack on only a relatively small amount of servers (8000 in the case of ethereum and all coins using that blockchain) can DoS many cryptocurrencies worldwide. Furthermore, over 46% of Ethereum&#x27;s servers are controlled by two parties, so if a government can seize those companies it&#x27;s likely capable of doing a 51% attack to sabotage many cryptocurrencies used on exchanges today.<p>I doubt there&#x27;s any risk of sabotage in practice, but like most digital payment methods, this stuff only works if there&#x27;s an internet connection.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="35882149" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35882149" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">anaganisk</span><span>|</span><a href="#35884887">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35882328">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35882149">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35882149">[77 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Contrary to popular belief, at least in my country (India).

Hot take. If you genuinely cared about these things, you&#x27;d end up a supporter of the Modi Govt.<p>I do not mind views that are diametrically opposite to me. But, every article in western media seems to be written by someone who is 1 degree of separation from the  Indian opposition. The claims are never backed by statistics, and the infographics are often so absurd that I have to wonder if I live in an upside-down world. Apparently, India has the 150th [1] least free press in the world and India has been a country with on average 2nd highest chance of genocide [2] for the entire last decade. Dig into their data a little bit, and you realize that they either only interviewed opponents of the current govt. or used zero data what-so-ever.<p>Note: Modi is the world&#x27;s most popular leader[3]. About 20% of Muslims and 30% of Christians voted for his 2nd term[4]. For reference, Republicans have never been able to come anywhere close to 20% of the black vote-share, and no is claiming that America will collapse when a Republican wins every alternate election.<p>The opinion of the average HNer on India, is as bad as a Q-anon supporter on American issues. I apologize for the somewhat angry tone I take on these threads. I do not intend to start a culture war. But when ignorance and arrogance are paired this frivolously, I can&#x27;t help but respond in kind.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rsf.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;index" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rsf.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;index</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;earlywarningproject.ushmm.org&#x2F;countries&#x2F;india" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;earlywarningproject.ushmm.org&#x2F;countries&#x2F;india</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;morningconsult.com&#x2F;global-leader-approval&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;morningconsult.com&#x2F;global-leader-approval&#x2F;</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;religion&#x2F;2021&#x2F;06&#x2F;29&#x2F;nationalism-and-politics&#x2F;pf_06-29-21_india-06-4&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;religion&#x2F;2021&#x2F;06&#x2F;29&#x2F;nationalism-...</a><p>[5] my previous rants on the matter - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;query=author%3Ascreye%20modi&amp;sort=byPopularity&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;que...</a></div><br/><div id="35883140" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35883140" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">windex</span><span>|</span><a href="#35882149">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35882754">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35884015">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35883140">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35883140">[9 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As a casual exercise, I would suggest you look for a graph of lynchings, riots, and raids in India especially of minorities and &quot;others&quot; for varying levels of trivial reasons by groups associated with the ruling party with patronage and overt support from it.

I&#x27;m honestly asking - no major country seems to be surviving the next 10 years as per your worldview.<p>I&#x27;m open to debate, but you seem to be inventing executions in thin air.<p>Sources:

The judiciary is either afraid of giving these gangsters actual sentences, or have been bribed by the gangsters. To solve this, the police has effectively taken the execution of justice into their own hand.<p>I know it may sound absurd, and the idea of the police taking matters into their own hands would normally scare me, but Uttar Pradesh seems to be an exception. The rule of law has broken down so completely it needs the law to be broken to be brought back, if that makes any sense to you.<p>The gangsters that were killed were a bit like the mafia in that sense - everyone knew they were crooks, and everyone knew what they did. It seems the tipping point for the ruling party to execute (or &#x27;encounter&#x27;, as it is called in India) these gangsters is when they kill policemen. Since the judiciary will not punish them, it becomes necessary for the police to inculcate a fear of the police in gangsters&#x27; minds in order for their policing activities to actually be effective.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="35884224" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35884224" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">closetnerd</span><span>|</span><a href="#35882149">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35883453">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35884214">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35883641">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35884224">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35884224">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Is there a source for the 41 lynchings in America?</div><br/><div id="35884904" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35884904" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">xNeil</span><span>|</span><a href="#35882149">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35884224">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35883641">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35884904">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35884904">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">In my above comment, in order to acertain the data and compare India&#x27;s statistics to those of the US, I tried googling it, but could not seem to find any reliable answers.

But not the way you might think.<p>Let me be clear. I am not a Bhakt, don&#x27;t particularly love Modi and have complained quite often about bad policies during his regime. My goal is to help people build a representative view of India, not one that fawns over Modi.<p>The BJP absolutely pushes for Hindutva, but &#x27;Hindutva&#x27; is an umbrella term that can mean anything from &#x27;places greater importance on cultural traditions that have been in the subcontinent longer&#x27; to &#x27;murderous nazis&#x27; depending on who you ask. Since you asked the question, it would help if you specify what you mean by hindutva.<p>to your question--&gt; what does &#x27;inclusivity&#x27; look like? If inclusivity is complete blindness towards religion in front of the law, then you get France style secularism which BJP pushes. On the other hand, you have the Congress&#x27;s secularism that is in complete contrast to those values. In that sense, both the BJP and the Congress are secular parties, without agreement on wat that term means.<p>85%+ of Indian muslims are pasmanda low-caste muslims. The previous govt. (congress) did not have a single pasmanda muslim represented in their govt. The BJP is now reaching out to them directly. India never had tribal representation at the national stage, and the BJP elected a tribal woman to the presidency. The BJP has time and again, promoted meritocratic candidates over nepo-babies, making the electoral system more inclusive. India is a not a nation divided on religion alone. It is mostly divided on economics. By focusing in more effective governance and distribution of social welfare, BJP&#x27;s govt. has disproportionately benefited the poorer population of India. These policies do not discriminate by religion or any other identity. Western style views of inclusivity do not translate well to other nations.<p>As for the bills like CAA, removal of 370 and the like. The Congress&#x27;s own policies show that these had bipartisan support up until the BJP brought it up. I don&#x27;t blame them, politics is politics. But, in isolation, both parties acknowledge that these were necessary changes for national security. The CAA was initially instituted by the Congress itself and the sorry state of section 370 at removal was also a result of bipartisan erosion of that bill over time. (it was meant to be a temporary provision anyway. But I won&#x27;t get into that right now).<p>Discussions around vague words like Hindutva and inclusivity are never productive. It would be more helpful to define what we mean by these terms. Create a list of policies implemented by the Modi govt. over the last 8 years and compare those against the govt. that came before. If there is a clear trend that emerges, then we can play ball. Or else, it is all smoke-and-mirrors.<p><pre><code>    somehow &quot;more inclusive&quot; than the policies that preceded it?
</code></pre>
That one I can say with confidence. The congress has been a party of nepotism for so long, that Modi did not have to do too much to appear more inclusive than them. Modi&#x27;s biggest strength right now, is the sheer incompetence of his opposition. They continuously pushed away their very best to the point of humiliation.</div><br/><div id="35883901" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35883901" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">braindead_in</span><span>|</span><a href="#35882149">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35883150">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35883228">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35883901">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35883901">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I am not a Bhakt,<p>I am a Bhakt.
