It can be used to infer the purchasability of a specific domain, which is a moderately-interesting API endpoint, since that requires talking to domain registries. For a while, nobody cared enough about it to abuse the endpoint. But then we started getting about 40 QPS of traffic. We normally get less than 1.<p>I was keeping an eye on it, because we are hard-capped at 100 QPS to our provider, beyond that and they start dropping our traffic (and it is an outside provider, bundling domain registries like verisign and stuff), which makes regular users break if their traffic gets unlucky.<p>Anyway, after a week of 40qps, they start spiking to 200+, and we pull the plug on the whole thing: now each request to our endpoint requires a recaptcha token. This is not great (more friction for legit users = more churn) but it is successful. IF they had only kept their QPS low, nobody would have cared. I wanted to send some kind of response code like, &quot;nearing quota&quot;.<p>FTR before people ask: it was quite difficult to stop this particular attack, since it worked like a DDOS, smeared across a _large_ number of ipv4 and ipv6 requesters. 50 QPS just isn&#x27;t enough quota to do stuff like reactively banning IP numbers if the attacker has millions of IPs available.</div><br/><div id="36110952" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36110952" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rapnie</span><span>|</span><a href="#36110689">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36111141">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36110952">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36110952">[31 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Maybe mCaptcha [0] is worth a look.

I think it&#x27;s probably at least marginally useful, but practically you&#x27;re limited by WebCrypto I think, which outperformed anything I could find in pure JS or WASM. The disadvantage of WebCrypto is that there&#x27;s a limited set of algorithms you can use and also, understandably, calculating hashes is async, so if you want a lot of rounds, you&#x27;ll spend a lot of time jumping in and out of the event loop. It&#x27;s still probably a useful speed bump or price increase for expensive operations: what might cost a few seconds on a typical phone or desktop is probably at least enough to act as a speed bump for attackers to perform it quickly (especially combined with other measures like throttling and progressively increasing PoW difficulty for an IP.) Maybe WebGPU could change this, but I&#x27;m weary of relying on all users having a fast GPU enabled in their browser just for this use case.<p>Though thinking about it, I wonder if there is a hybrid: start with a difficulty that&#x27;s just a few seconds for CPU&#x2F;WebCrypto and ramp up quickly, but also support WebGPU where possible so that web users on abusive connections may still succeed?

This is better than having every user compute their own PoW as they&#x27;d purchase a small amount of cryptocurrency from an ASIC farm, which should be cheaper&#x2F;faster&#x2F;more efficient than using their local hardware. I mostly agree with the concept, but I don&#x27;t think any such API exists yet with enough adoption to consider this a real option any time soon.<p>Right now, if I was to ask my users to do a proof of burn for $0.0001 of BTC most of them would just close my site as they don&#x27;t have any BTC. The process of setting up an account on an exchange, waiting several hours&#x2F;days for KYC checks to clear, adding a credit card, buying BTC, sending it to a browser extension, and then trying the signup again is a *significant* initial hurdle. If we were in a world where I could assume all my users already owned BTC, that&#x27;s a different story, but we haven&#x27;t seen adoption of cryptocurrency anywhere near that level. I don&#x27;t expect PoW schemes to drive that adoption either, so this seems like a poor solution today.<p>Do you happen to know if a hCaptcha&#x2F;mCaptcha-like micro-proof-of-burn tool exists already? I&#x27;d be happy to be proven wrong.<p>That brings us back to options that exist today, which includes every user computing their own PoW. Looking at mCaptcha some more, it uses a SHA256 derivative so it&#x27;s compute-hard and vulnerable to GPUs&#x2F;ASICs. The author mentions some of those concerns in an earlier thread [1]. I wonder if a different proof-of-work algorithm would be better, like a memory-hard PoW, proof-of-space, and&#x2F;or proof-of-wait.

The only users who would be adversely affected are those who perform hundreds of requests per second <i>from a single system.</i><p>Virtually every major website has per-host inbound request limits. This is completely standard practice and Archive.org is the odd one here.<p>And DDoS isn&#x27;t the only concern. Legitimate users that run poorly written Python scripts that make insane numbers of requests can hog server resources, and rate limits with appropriate error messages linking to resources documenting efficient access patterns can improve the experience for everyone, and drastically cut costs for the service operators.</div><br/><div id="36111285" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36111285" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">phkx</span><span>|</span><a href="#36110664">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36111131">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36110961">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36111285">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36111285">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It‘s rather per public IP, such that e.g. behind a corporate proxy you may experience rate limiting even for regular use, just because you’re sharing a few IP addresses with a large number of users.

Of course it is archive.org role to reach out first. For example EU could fund an archive.org mirror in the EU (with certain throughout etc).<p>Of course opponents of public&#x2F;government funding have a very good point in that many organisations when they get public money, they find a way to burn through all of it in a lot less efficient way.

I think the question was raised in sincerity, and I think it offers a point of discussion for those not familiar with the issues.<p>I don’t think it’s helpful to flag things people disagree with, as long as they don’t attempt to spread misinformation, or trolling etc. The parent phrased the topic as a question, meaning I believe they were open to understanding.<p>I also think it’s relative to the topic posted, as we’re talking about either an attack on archive.org, or a massive recopying of archive data by an unknown.<p>Talking to people with opposing views is important. Let’s not just shut people down if we don’t agree with something, especially when someone is asking a question.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="36110674" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36110674" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ddtaylor</span><span>|</span><a href="#36110665">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36110837">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36110999">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36110674">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36110674">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Details?</div><br/><div id="36110696" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36110696" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">shlant</span><span>|</span><a href="#36110665">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36110674">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36110999">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36110696">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36110696">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">found this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.archive.org&#x2F;2017&#x2F;04&#x2F;17&#x2F;robots-txt-meant-for-search-engines-dont-work-well-for-web-archives&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.archive.org&#x2F;2017&#x2F;04&#x2F;17&#x2F;robots-txt-meant-for-sea...</a></div><br/><div id="36110740" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36110740" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">avarun</span><span>|</span><a href="#36110665">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36110696">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36110999">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36110740">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36110740">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Seems reasonable</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
