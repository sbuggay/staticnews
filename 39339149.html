I think the end result will be much smaller planes that do point to point but the exact &#x27;how will it happen&#x27; is still an unknown. This will force regulatory changes too since a lot more smaller = totally different airspace management and cockpit requirements (please allow autonomous!). My personal bet for the disruptor to do it is is on electric. Look at the graph of battery capacity&#x2F;kg&#x2F;year and it is clear that electric will out-pace JET-A in the not distant future. The benefits are massive when that happens since (as the article points out) developing engines is a huge part of the challenge. Electric engines are going to be vastly easier to design and certify and provide massive new options since they can be mounted in new ways making aircraft more efficient and cheaper to build and operate. They will also likely change the altitudes and speeds that aircraft fly at since the same issues that impact turbofan engines don&#x27;t impact electric (there are other issues obviously though).</div><br/><div id="39342893" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39342893" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">samtho</span><span>|</span><a href="#39341801">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39342024">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39342834">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39342893">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39342893">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The industry is very entrenched in regulation that is not going to change anytime soon. I just find it difficult to imagine any room for disruption with an agency like the FAA having full  control over who and what gets to pilot an airplane, but also hates to certify experimental aircraft. Autonomous aircraft are going to be a century away at least due in part to red tape because there is almost no on-ramp to enter this industry.<p>I am also not hopeful for battery technology as, unlike cars, where we are not weight sensitive, commercial aircraft rely on being able to land lighter than they took off due to fuel burn. In small aircraft, battery storage can work for short runs, but we’re going to need to see some sort of fuel cell system for anything commercially viable.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39342834" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39342834" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">peweet</span><span>|</span><a href="#39341801">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39342024">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39342893">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39342406">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39342834">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39342834">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Only someone unversed in the aerospace industry could make such a claim. The barrier to entry is vast. It isnt like other industries where you can break things and rapidly innovate. Ive seen first hand how hard it is to translate innovation onto the factor floor. For example there is innovation on AI or more accurately neural nets for the complex software governing landing gears that is functionally impossible to implement.  What already exists, is essentially a million line IF statement governing every atmospheric condition and different angle gradient. The trick is getting the new innovation past the regulator in such a way that it is demonstrably more safe.<p>What currently exists, presumably took decades to write and improve and tweak for every possible scenario and is extremely robust. It is also propriety vital software out of control of both Airbus and Boeing. Meaning it is both expensive and creates a huge amount of leverage on the part of the supplier as no aircraft can be delivered without a landing gear and there is a very limited amount of companies who can produce it.<p>While the neural nets perform better in lab scenarios it is probable the innovation will never be permitted to be deployed as it is extremely difficult to demonstrate if it is superior and more crucially: safer, than the tried and tested horreondous milion line statement. It could take 5-10 years of further testing and its only objective may be to just have some leverage in negotations (that both parties will know its very weak ammunition).<p>The second bottleneck is you need a huge ecosystem of suppliers (much like the electric&#x27;s ecosystem in Shenzhen) which can rapidly and safely fulfill purchase orders. The manufacturing is about the highest most precise manufacturing there is. Just to train someone to install parts on the assembly line can take 12-18 months. Also some suppliers such as CFMA, Rolls royce, P&amp;W, GE will never entertain a small start up because why would they?<p>They plan production in terms of 5-10 years and they need deep commitments to satisfy their creditors and their workforce. Can a startup sign a 10-15 year service agreement that guarantees revenue for maintenance? Can a start up guarantee other types of corporate agreements on spare parts or engineering workshops or the other thousand myriad different exchanges of information.<p>These plants produce engines on maybe a monthly or quarterly basis. The parts inside the engines are protected on a national security  basis as they are so difficult to manufacture. The engineering IP is a genuine national security risk as it can be translated into jet fighters.<p>Aerospace industry is about as open to disruption as big pharma is. Its surrounded by arcane redtape such as Airworthiness directives that are designed to make sure no one dies.<p>Where you could see innovation is electric or hydrogen  for short haul flights on smaller planes. The problem is the batteries and hydrogen especially, can be more dangerous than the current kerosene.<p>The MTOW (Max take of weight) for batteries is vastly higher than kerosene and the energy is used up far faster. The aerospace manufacturers are researching green jet fuel which could be a good way to reduce emissions.<p>The regulators will never slacken on the rigidity of the regulation. It is so easy to make a minor mistake in manufacturing that can result in a mass casuality event.<p>In fact for every new engineer that joins Airbus, they are first shown a musuem dedicated to all victims of previous disasters to demonstrate what is at stake and how important engineering excellence is.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39342406" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39342406" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">AtlasBarfed</span><span>|</span><a href="#39341801">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39342024">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39341817">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39342406">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39342406">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I know that self driving cars are eyerolling to hear about, but highway self-driving with convergent infrastructure (not the drive-me-thru-Taco-Bell kind) is going to come to trucking, for the basic reason that you can drive the trucks overnight at a minimum.<p>Smaller planes seem mostly designed for shorter flights, but if I can get a better-than-sober-me stats on highways, and I can sleep in a car while it drives me to another city, why would I fly?<p>- take a lot more stuff with you<p>- for families it will be insanely cheaper<p>- if an EV, it will be lower carbon<p>- I will have a car for last mile&#x2F;city driving when I get there<p>- much better seats<p>I honestly think the 20 year prognosis for &lt;800 mile flights is going to be really bad. 800 miles flying is 2 hours + taxiing + waiting in line + transport to airport + giving yourself enough buffer + land&#x2F;get luggage + ground transport. That is probably 5-6 hours in many situations.<p>So a 10-11 hour drive where you don&#x27;t have to pay attention and can sleep overnight would be my primary choice if I could do it now. Even if there was, say, a 1500 mile trip to florida, if there is someone to visit along the way, I&#x27;ll drive.<p>Anyway, the gist of it is that I think large planes or trips with water barriers are what the industry will end up with, I don&#x27;t anticipate some massive groundswell of air travel demand for shorter flights in the long run.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39341817" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39341817" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">yedava</span><span>|</span><a href="#39341801">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39342257">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39341817">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39341817">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">When we think of centrally planned economies, we think of things like communism.

Where are all the delta wings and other exotic designs used regularly in military aircraft?!<p>IMHO there are two things with the potential to revolutionize passenger aviation brewing right now.  One is the possible return of supersonic flight, with Boom racking up some 150 orders already, although they still have a <i>long</i> way to go until first passenger flight in 2029 (not holding my breath).  The other is switching from aviation fuel to electric engines, which is inevitable, although the sheer weight of batteries is a much bigger problem for flight than for cars and it&#x27;s likely going to take a decade plus until they&#x27;re competitive for longer distances.</div><br/><div id="39342714" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39342714" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zokier</span><span>|</span><a href="#39342257">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39342495">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39342714">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39342714">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It is also common meme that all new cars look the same<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;swlh&#x2F;the-zombie-mobile-b03932ac971d" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;swlh&#x2F;the-zombie-mobile-b03932ac971d</a><p>This is just a signal that the field is mature and the design is near local optimum.<p>tbh I don&#x27;t see that much exotic designs in military aircraft either.

Lockheed ended up abandoning the commercial aircraft market after losing $2.5 billion on the program (~$9 billion in 2023 dollars), and McDonnell-Douglas never recovered, ultimately selling itself to Boeing in 1997 as its market share declined and it was unable to fund the development of new aircraft.”<p>I don’t think anyone who worked in the industry would attribute the 1997 merger to the DC-10 some 30-40 years earlier. First off, the DC-10 is, as the name implies, a Douglas aircraft. That fiasco did indeed cause a merger, to McDonnell… in 1967.<p>Also, if McDonnell-Douglas “never recovered”, how did it afford to fund in the 80s and early 90s, the enormously expensive design and development of the C17, entirely with its own money? An effort so expensive no aerospace company ever tried to do it again?<p>The cause of the 1997 merger was if anything the loss of the JSF contract in 1996 (which became the F35) , which was made necessary by the preceding loss of the ATF contract (which became the F22) and slow sales of the MD-11; most analyses of the 1997 merger focus on the MDC-Boeing rival in commercial airliners, but MDC would have lived through the MD-11 and the merger would have never happened in 1997 if it hadn’t lost two generational fighter contracts.
