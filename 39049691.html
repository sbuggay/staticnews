It&#x27;s almost certainly the firewall&#x27;s URL Filtering feature (aka PAN-DB).<p>When someone makes an HTTP request, the firewall takes the host and path from the request and looks them up first in a local cache on the data plane, then in the cloud. (As you can imagine, bypassing the entire feature is therefore trivial for malware. You just open a connection to an arbitrary IP address and put, say, google.com in the host header. As far as the firewall can tell, you are in fact talking to google.com.)<p>When the URL isn&#x27;t already known to the cloud, or hasn&#x27;t been visited more recently than its TTL, it goes into a queue to be refreshed by the crawler, which will make its way there shortly thereafter to classify the page.<p>Palo Alto has other URL scanners, but none that would reliably visit the page <i>after</i> the user.

So I read this as &quot;The sessions weren&#x27;t authenticated, so where on earth did they even find these URLs?&quot;<p>The answer is that there&#x27;s a real, authenticated user behind a firewall, and every unknown URL this user visits is getting queued up for the crawler to classify later, query string and all.

It could be corporate spyware (i.e. forced on users by the IT department), or an extension that only tends to be used by large institutions (because it relates to some expensive enterprise product). Alternatively, it could be a much more popular browser extension, but it only executes this capture when it determines that the user is within a target list of large institutions.<p>I&#x27;m making the same guess as the author about the execution process: that the code is shipping a huge amount of page content to a cloud server, e.g. the full DOM, and then rendering that DOM in this older Chrome version. It&#x27;s <i>not</i> fetching the same page from the origin server, which is how it&#x27;s able to do this without auth cookies.<p>As part of rendering, the page&#x27;s script tags all get executed again, which is why Upollo is seeing this. (Note that I don&#x27;t know if this re-execution of script tags is deliberate. There&#x27;s a good chance that it&#x27;s an unintended side-effect of loading the DOM into Chrome, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to break anything so nobody&#x27;s bothered to disable it.)<p>It&#x27;s only sampling a small percentage of executions, which is why it&#x27;s not continually happening for every interaction by these users.<p>It&#x27;s waiting ten seconds so that the page&#x27;s network interactions are likely to have finished by then. Waiting longer would increase the odds of the user navigating to another page before the code has had a chance to run.<p>The article doesn&#x27;t say if there are particular kinds of pages being grabbed, but looking for commonality between them would help.<p>The main thing that stumps me – assuming I&#x27;ve understood it correctly – is why the second render is happening across such a diverse set of cloud networks.</div><br/><div id="39051017" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39051017" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">caydenm</span><span>|</span><a href="#39050927">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39051685">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39051017">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39051017">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Browser extension is what we originally thought for exactly the same reasons you did.
