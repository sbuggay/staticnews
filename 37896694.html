The reasons why it would not be allowed are fairly minimal. The only reasons allowed are:<p>- Nobody else can take over the work (ie very specialized knowledge)<p>- Insurmountable problems with work shift planning (simply having to hire another person is not considered insurmountable)<p>- Not enough money or work (rare, would primarily occur for people wanting to work <i>more</i> instead of less)<p>- No space in the personnel formation (would presumably also mostly apply for people wanting to work more rather than less)<p>In addition this law only applies to companies with more than 10 employees, the employee requesting part time has to work there for at least 26 weeks and they need to file the request at least 8 weeks in advance (to give the employer time to hire additional people)<p>That said, yes it is great and I agree completely with TFA. I fully believe that having 5 employees at 32 hours&#x2F;week is better for a company than 4 employees at 40 hours&#x2F;week, for the reasons stated in the article. It is better for employees too, because an extra day a week to do errands (while the kids are at school!) brings some much needed extra time in a household where both partners are working.
