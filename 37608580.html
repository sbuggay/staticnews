Thanks for the pos&#x2F;neg&#x2F;neutral comments everybody. Some remarks:<p>Yes, there are a lot of browsers out there where I can contribute to which would be more efficient. But that would result in just a few browsers instead of a lot of browsers. I&#x27;m all for the last one, as this would give people options.<p>This IS a pet project. I never told anyone otherwise. I would start writing it even when I wasn&#x27;t fed up with the tech industry. But I get angry about not being able to do anything about anything. And this is my way of trying to do something about it. It&#x27;s the best I can do.<p>I think this project will not result in an actual browser. That&#x27;s not why i&#x27;m writing this. I want people to see my code, either laugh at it, or get some own idea&#x27;s to make things better. For instance, I LOVE the whatwg site where the whole html5 tokenizer and parser algorithms are step by step described. This means it should be easy(?) enough for anyone to write their own html5 parser. What would happen if google and&#x2F;or microsoft decide to create their own custom html5 (html5, ghtml) as a closed format? Who would be able to stop them when they have such a market share?<p>I want to start for scratch - BECAUSE i want to know more about the underlying technical challenges.</div><br/><div id="37609581" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37609581" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nonrandomstring</span><span>|</span><a href="#37609316">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37609602">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37609581">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37609581">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I get angry about not being able to do anything about anything.

    this is my way of trying to do something about it. It&#x27;s the best I
    can do.<p>This attitude is gold, and it&#x27;s what changes the whole world.<p>What you said about the misery of &quot;news&quot; resonates with me. In psyops
we call it &quot;sapping&quot;. Propaganda designed to demoralise, dispirit and
corrode resistance used to come from our <i>enemies</i>. The classic
example was Lord Haw-Haw [0].  Today our own mainstream news channels
and technology giants seem determined to keep the population in
perpetual hopeless anxiety.<p>As you do, I find the discourse around tech to be a pit of
dismissiveness, avoidance, denial, resignation, and
learned-helplessness. I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of interviewing people
lately, and careful sentiment analysis. The results are horrifying.
The very word &quot;tech&quot; is becoming synonymous with &quot;Resistance is
futile&quot;.<p>To stand up and do something, anything, not because you hope for
success, but as an example, and for your own sanity, is the most
positive and human of responses.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lord_Haw-Haw" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lord_Haw-Haw</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="37609602" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37609602" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">vidarh</span><span>|</span><a href="#37609316">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37609581">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37609551">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37609602">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37609602">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; This IS a pet project<p>I think that is a great attitude to start with.<p>When you build something with the attitude that it&#x27;s for you and not &quot;meant to be big and professional like GNU&quot; to paraphrase Linus Torvalds, you can often achieve a lot with far less effort.<p>It allows you to be pragmatic and accept things that you otherwise might not, and you can get to something <i>useful to you</i> whether as a learning experience or to actually use with a tiny fraction of the effort  you&#x27;d want to invest if you intended to build a &quot;product&quot;.<p>A lot of my personal projects have involved stumbling over a project like yours and repurposing parts, and often veering off in entirely different directions, because it&#x27;s often so much easier to pick up someones small pet project that is &quot;close enough&quot; than trying to pare down or adapt a huge, feature-complete beast.<p>With a browser, a huge part of the complexity comes from needing to support every site out there, and every usage scenario, but when you build for you, already just being able to focus on making sites you care about work well enough pares the problem back enormously...<p>And this is a long way of saying I think more people should take on &quot;impossible&quot; projects.
