So it taught me a very simple lesson of patience and delayed gratification, where if I simply bought stuff at 5, and waited a few weeks&#x2F;months until it went up to 15-25, I could sell with a high profit.<p>As I acquired more &quot;capital&quot;, I could make bigger purchases with bigger payoffs over time, and I made far more buying and selling these stocks than I could ever have performing &quot;labor&quot; (playing the games for points), thus teaching me the second lesson on capital leverage.<p>I think a few years in, they realized people were doing this, and they added a purchase floor of $15, where you couldn&#x27;t buy something unless it was $15 or more, which limited my ultra-simple strategy&#x27;s profitability, but I still kept doing it for a few more years before growing up and moving onto other games.<p>A final funny anecdote, there was this one stock called BOOM (Boom Boom Boxes), which would very regularly shoot up in value to 100s -&gt; 1000s in price (way beyond everything else which typically topped out in the 10s). And there was this strategy to always buy BOOM when it was cheap, because it would surely multiply like crazy. And one day they announced that BOOM was the first stock to go &quot;bankrupt&quot;, resulting in everyone losing a ton of money as it went to 0. Thus teaching me the third lesson about &quot;bubbles&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m astounded I remember this much detail from a game I played when I was 10 years old.</div><br/><div id="37477078" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37477078" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Huggernaut</span><span>|</span><a href="#37476418">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37477076">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37477078">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37477078">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I was one of the lucky 2,000 players to receive 500,000 neopoints as part of the billion neopoints giveaway in 2000.

Today it&#x27;s probably not a big deal, but back then it was wasn&#x27;t something you saw in any other cage, everyone stopped to take a peak, new people always asked about it, and I always thought it was super cool even if they had to crimp everything themselves.<p>They had a fairly sizable cage and I passed by it everyday.

I still have screenshots!<p>You could submit it to HN and see if there&#x27;s uptake. There&#x27;s also Algolia.<p>The beauty of Utopia was that you start a province and you get together with max 24 other players in a kingdom. You vote which province becomes your king or queen, and you gotta work together with those other provinces. If it doesn&#x27;t work out you can leave, but it comes with a penalty.<p>However even back then, trading, botting, and account sharing was rampant. Because it was an international game with people around the world, and sometimes you had to log in the middle of the night. And people had RL, too.<p>The cool thing about Utopia was the politics aspect. War, negotiations and all that. The dark side of it were pacts and people who resort to mentioned cheating but who also bullied to get on top. It is probably akin to Eve Online in that way (which seems way more complex).<p>&gt; It probably has the hardest learning curves of any game ever made, but the community is really strong and encouraging.<p>Nah, not the hardest. Utopia Angel (which ran through Wine) made Utopia fairly easy cause it was an accurate combat sim, and later on there were Web 2.0 frontends for scraped&#x2F;normalized data, and also sims available for the province non-combat features.<p>Neopets I started because the woman I fell in love with digged it. Honestly I thought it was kind of cute and akin to a browser-based MMO (like Utopia was, too). The market is just like in WoW auction house; a sim of its own kind. But the fondest memories I have regarding those massive puzzles they sometimes had. They were an adventure within Neopets, and an adventure into studying your browser and things like Flash. WoW also has a MMO puzzle adventure going for it right now. For WoW, my fondest memories are action related and MoP expansion (yes I played before MoP, even WC2 and WC3 when released).

It taught me basic market fundamentals (and led to early experiments with HTML, CSS, coding, and graphic design) but it was also my first brush with internet addiction, and I suspect it contributed to the development of ongoing stimuli-related executive dysfunction. The remaining users (primarily adults) seem to exhibit similar tendencies and&#x2F;or other psychological issues.<p>My parents hated it. Having been exposed to gambling mechanics [0][1] from a young age, I would never allow my children to be exposed to anything similar. I sometimes jokingly think of myself as an early casualty of the loot box era. Thankfully, few games have this effect on me; somehow this one remains uniquely addictive, a kind of perfect and insidious formula.<p>The history of the site is an interesting case study in digital currencies, user retention curves, and the collapse of early social media. After a corporate buyout and subsequent mass exodus, it was largely dormant for years until being purchased and revived by the original lead developer.<p>Many parts of it are completely broken and abandoned. It&#x27;s a UX nightmare, extremely cringe, and basically needs to be gutted to have any hope of attracting new users. But a small, dedicated, and vocal user base remains. If the fundamentals are correct, sometimes people will stick around, even if management decisions are continually at odds with what users want. It helps that the items are also the best they&#x27;ve ever been, drawn by talented pixel artists who probably used Gaia when they were teenagers.<p>I still have immense respect for the original incarnation and vision of the site. It emerged directly from the dotcom fallout, and was created by a small group of anime artists&#x2F;programmers hacking away in a communal San Diego bungalow. It&#x27;s one of the few relics of my childhood left on the internet, and I suspect it will be around for years to come.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.kym-cdn.com&#x2F;photos&#x2F;images&#x2F;newsfeed&#x2F;000&#x2F;835&#x2F;640&#x2F;c54.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.kym-cdn.com&#x2F;photos&#x2F;images&#x2F;newsfeed&#x2F;000&#x2F;835&#x2F;640&#x2F;c54...</a>
