They&#x27;ve got showrooms in key large cities in North America, fancy schmancy top end stuff.<p>The factory was a real place; the frames were made of solid wood and plywood, there was a sewing floor and even one (incredibly kooky) person whose sole job was to stuff the pillows. This guy was in a little room full of feathers all day, and they&#x27;d follow him around to the cantina and bathroom like a cartoon character.. but I digress.<p>My job there for a while was to make the sofa legs -- that was a sixteen step process, and they didn&#x27;t even trust me to glue the boards together, just to do the cuts and shape the pieces. Sand and stain and wax and polish, yes sir!<p>They had a dedicated delivery crew, and what the article mentions about packaging is true -- things would be blanketed and wrapped up just the right way, then tetris-ed onto the truck. Sitting shotgun on that truck and hauling sofas up stairs and through various spaces was what I did after making the legs got too boring.<p>These sofas sold for $3000 ~ $4000 and up, and that was at the break of the millennium. I think the cheapest chair they had was around $2000. I should really swing by the showroom and see how much these are now -- and whether they&#x27;re still made like they used to be.</div><br/><div id="39713492" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39713492" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">brandall10</span><span>|</span><a href="#39709815">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39710211">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39713492">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39713492">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Any reason you can&#x27;t mention the company?

The legs were about 1&#x2F;2” wide, maybe a bit more. They were maybe 1” tall (vertically in the horizontal section and horizontally in the vertical section).<p>So the grain needed to run horizontally in the horizontal part to support the bending load. It was probably best for the grain to be vertical in the vertical part, although that was maybe less critical: that section was mostly in compression.  It probably also looked better that way.<p>In any case, the actual construction put a finger joint in the horizontal section just past the turn, so a tiny bit of vertical grain wood extended horizontally over the turn. And several of the legs cracked just along the side of the finger joint, and one failed completely after about a month of gentle use.<p>The design plausibly could have worked if the joint went diagonally through the turn or was below it. But plywood is strong along both in-plane axes, and the legs could likely have been cut in single pieces from sheets of plywood with strength to spare.<p>Attractive plywood, even from hardwood species, is readily available.  The plies are visible along the cut edge, but this is actually a style people like, especially in Scandinavian furniture.

Sometimes a piece of furniture has no hidden internal structure, or the appeal of the furniture is that it is all bare wood and you want it made entirely out of a beautiful &quot;furniture grade&quot; hardwood. For certain upholstered furniture, such as many sofas, using expensive materials for inner framing could not only be superfluous and add unnecessary cost to the piece, but in certain circumstances there may be better materials available even if you could make a perfectly adequate structural support that will last a lifetime using expensive hardwood and the right joinery for critical stress points.<p>I read amulto&#x27;s point as being &quot;expensive material and fancy joinery doesn&#x27;t matter if you have a weak design.&quot;</div><br/></div></div><div id="39710045" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39710045" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bombcar</span><span>|</span><a href="#39707313">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39707784">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39707897">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39709306">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39710045">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39710045">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Plywood is amazingly structurally sound, because it&#x27;s got grain going all which ways.<p>Especially when thin, wood is surprisingly easy to break, and it doesn&#x27;t handle being pulled on very well at all.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="39709586" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39709586" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gerdesj</span><span>|</span><a href="#39707313">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39707357">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39707515">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39712384">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39709586">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39709586">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I recently visited Hong Kong.

Remember, they have money because they are better than you, definitely not because there are systems and structures in place that make it easier to get rich for the already wealthy and connected.<p>Unfortunately it seems so many people really struggle to understand that while quality often costs a lot, costing a lot does not imply quality in any way.

The two might be using the same material but the price difference comes from the person assembling the item.<p>The problem is you have a ton of companies (even &quot;luxury&quot; ones), that in an attempt to juice their stock price, have also focused on getting costs super low and are now using the same factories as junk brands but just slapping their logo on it.

I found one on Apt2B which they were touting was built around an robotically-welded steel frame, lending to consistent durability. After reading many sofa reviews mentioning buckling particleboard, that sounded pretty good. There weren’t a ton of options due to pandemic shortages so I went for it, which cost me $1500.<p>It’s held up well so far.

Book cases are not designed by people who own a lot of books. 36&quot; to 48&quot; spans of fast growth pine will stretch and bow within a year or two. I designed my own book case. I went to a furniture making store. We went back and forth a few times. The biggest sticking point that took four attempts for the furniture maker to understand was where to put the fixed shelf. It does not go in the middle because that wastes space. We made it out of pine. 7&#x27; 8&quot; tall, so that when standing it up, it will clear an 8ft ceiling in modern American homes. 22&quot; wide shelves so they cannot flex. Fixed shelf to counteract gravity. Made specifically to carry paperback novels and similarly sized books. &quot;Sand it three times, prime it, sand it, prime it, sand it, paint it, sand it, paint it, no I don&#x27;t care that a single book case will cost $200.&quot; I bought 24 of them. Many hundreds of lineal feet of book cases. We still have them 24 years later and they are as good as new. And the paint job, because it is two layers of prime and two layers of paint, on a mirror surface, looks like you just took the item from the showroom floor.<p>I have a plywood bookcase I made to store cooking books. The cheapest plywood you can imagine from the big box store. But because of the structural design, 15 years later it still holds up without any bowing or flexing.<p>Modern furniture is absolute junk.

This was around 5 years old at the time, and was a cheap sectional (at most $600, possibly less, I don&#x27;t recall), my wife convinced me to go cheap because &quot;the kids will destroy anything we get&quot;.<p>I will agree with the upholstery person in this article: it&#x27;s not going to be worth it to pay someone to do it.  I ended up reupholstering ours for around $500, but that&#x27;s because I did all the labor myself.  An amazing amount of work.<p>It was made with a lot of OSB, some of the most curved pine I&#x27;ve ever seen, and lots and lots of staples.<p>I fixed the frame by adding a variety of supports and glue and screws.  The frame went from being barely sufficient to quite solid.  I doubled the webbing and springs, and completely rebuilt the cushions.  To an extent I used the existing fabric as the patterns for the new fabric, except: my wife wanted the cushions to have piping (that was a huge effort), and originally it had the back cushions built in and stuffed with polyfill, but I wanted to make them removable so I had to redesign the back and custom design the cushions.<p>The biggest mistakes I made were the foam I used for the cushions was way too firm.  If I were to redo it I would do something like a 3 layer: firm, medium, maybe latex or low density memory foam.  I&#x27;d also probably have used a leather considering all the effort I put in, largely to keep the cats at bay.<p>The real down side is that we&#x27;re thinking of getting rid of it because it&#x27;s really too big for our space, and unless I redo the cushions it&#x27;s way too firm to use without additional pillows.  But, despite all the work I put into it, I&#x27;d be willing to bet that we could&#x27;t sell it, and probably couldn&#x27;t give it away (selling furniture on craigslist is so frustrating).<p>End result: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;photos.app.goo.gl&#x2F;Q8DMxQU7L9AggCBDA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;photos.app.goo.gl&#x2F;Q8DMxQU7L9AggCBDA</a>  Starting reassembly: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;photos.app.goo.gl&#x2F;rQRJfmYmSLew3rSN8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;photos.app.goo.gl&#x2F;rQRJfmYmSLew3rSN8</a></div><br/></div></div><div id="39707455" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39707455" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bombcar</span><span>|</span><a href="#39711819">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39708302">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39707455">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39707455">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve liked reading this blog - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;insidersguidetofurniture.com&#x2F;buyers-guide-to-furniture&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;insidersguidetofurniture.com&#x2F;buyers-guide-to-furnitu...</a> and basically what it comes down to is most modern cushioning will fail in five years or so.<p>You need 2.5 density foam or higher, or you need a &quot;uncushioned&quot; style couch.</div><br/><div id="39709446" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39709446" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jonah</span><span>|</span><a href="#39707455">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39707567">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39709446">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39709446">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I second your comment on high-quality foam.

Classic capitalism and free-market economics where everyone wins.<p>But now it no longer matters if people need sofas, or whether anyone actually gets anything remote to a &quot;fair deal&quot;, or any externalities like climate change, or if kids in Vietnam are being exploited. Burn the world, as long as I can sell my crummy sofa, because &quot;free market allows it&quot; is the only logical and moral argument that exists for some people. A sofa is no longer a product; it&#x27;s just the means to making a profit.

The suspension underneath the cushions is criss-crossed webbing in a softwood frame.  Well you can imagine, a 90lb child jumping on that, the forces that develop. And then the frame breaks at the front.  And there&#x27;s nothing structural at the front of the sofa, just some 1&#x2F;4&quot; thick fiberboard, to anchor replacement frame material to so you can&#x27;t really fix it.<p>Oh well.  One of them now has solid plywood - very well fastened to what structural elements are available - so it&#x27;s now very firm but the kids don&#x27;t care.  The other, I had the inspiration of mounting the plywood lower and putting another layer of cushioning in there (leftover seat cushions from the demolished Ektorp sofas).  That&#x27;s actually pretty good.<p>But without rambunctious kids, these sofas, which were already 10-15 years old, would have lasted quite a while longer.
