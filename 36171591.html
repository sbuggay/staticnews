From what I understand:<p>1. Instead of a traditional IPO, Slack went public through an alternative process called a direct listing.<p>2. As part of its direct listing, Slack sold some million &quot;registered&quot; and some million &quot;unregistered&quot; shares.<p>3. What are registered and unregistered shares? I could not find an explanation on Wikipedia.<p>4. Fiyyaz Pirrani purchased some number of shares, but later complained that Slack had misrepresented something in its declarations before going public. He filed suit against the company.<p>5. SCOTUS says that because Fiyyaz Pirrani could not tell which of his shares were registered and which were unregistered, he could not prove standing(?)<p>6. This problem would not have arisen with an IPO (because?). On the other hand, similar doubts will arise with all future direct listings, making investors hesitant to purchase shares in the corresponding companies.<p>Is this an accurate assessment?

From the added context:<p>7. Pirrani&#x27;s suit relied on Section 11 of the Securities Act. This alleges that the company lied in its registration document.<p>8. In an IPO, all shares are covered by the registration document. In a direct listing, the current shareholders of the company just start trading their shares on the market one day.<p>9. Notably, a direct listing makes it unclear which shares are registered (covered by the registration document) and which are unregistered. According to SCOTUS, Pirrani can&#x27;t tell, so he can&#x27;t prove standing under Section 11.<p>10. He should have sued the company under Section 10 of the Securities Act instead. This is the same mechanism used against &quot;mature&quot; companies. Lawyers don&#x27;t like to sue under Section 10 because of reasons.<p>Some stuff which is still unclear to me:<p>1. People speak of owning n shares of a company. I always thought this was simply shorthand for something like: &quot;I own shares #1034852, #1092647, and #2986246&quot;.<p>2. People sometimes own 0.25 shares of a company, but I thought that this was a convenience invented by stock brokers like Fidelity and Robinhood.<p>3. If each share is associated with a share number, and people only hold whole shares in principle, then isn&#x27;t the provenance of that share clear? Whether it is registered or not should simply be a matter of following it back in time?</div><br/><div id="36174909" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36174909" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">usr1106</span><span>|</span><a href="#36172231">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36172449">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36172694">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36174909">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36174909">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; 9.

According to SCOTUS, Pirrani can&#x27;t tell, so he can&#x27;t prove standing under Section 11.<p>Right. If you read judge Gorsuch&#x27;s statement quoted in the article a bit between the lines, he says: The Securities Act is a nonsense law in this aspect. If a company makes incorrect statements in a public listing and offer you shares they will be liable. But if you buy shares of the same company from someone else who owned the shares before the company was listed, the company is not liable for their wrongdoing. There is no reason why some shares of the same type of a single company deserve more protection than others depending on who was a previous owner. A dysfunctional law.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36172694" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36172694" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">MacsHeadroom</span><span>|</span><a href="#36172231">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#36172449">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36174909">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36172685">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36172694">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36172694">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; I always thought this was simply shorthand for something like: &quot;I own shares #1034852, #1092647, and #2986246&quot;.<p>Nope, (private) shares are almost always fungible and not numbered&#x2F;serialized in any way.<p>In fact most shares are just a name followed by a number of shares in an excel spreadsheet or Google sheet at best, if not simply a declaration in founding documents.<p>&gt; People sometimes own 0.25 shares of a company, but I thought that this was a convenience invented by stock brokers like Fidelity and Robinhood.<p>Again, no. Fractional shares are very normal. Any time shares are created (via dilution, additional investment, etc.) some existing grants and holdings are likely to become fractional. Usually fractional shares are calculated to the third or fourth decimal place.<p>Many shareholders in the forementioned spreadsheet will have their share amount tied to a % calculation which will inevitably resolve to a fractional share amount.<p>Say a share is worth $500, are you okay with $500 rounding errors?
