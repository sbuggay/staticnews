I wrote the original compiler back in 2002&#x2F;2003, but a lot changed by the time it was open sourced (including the confusing name -- I just called it a javascript compiler).<p>One detail this story gets wrong though is the claim that, &quot;The Gmail team found that runtime JavaScript performance was almost irrelevant compared to download times.&quot; Runtime performance was actually way more important than download size and we put a lot of effort into making the JS fast (keep in mind that IE6 was the _best_ browser at the time). One of the key functions of the js compiler was inlining and dead-code removal so that we could keep the code readable without introducing any extra overhead.</div><br/><div id="37699379" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37699379" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">cletus</span><span>|</span><a href="#37699258">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37700212">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37699379">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37699379">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I used Closure at Google after coming from a Java background. I always described it as &quot;Closure puts the Java into JavaScript&quot;. The team I was working on found several bugs where live code was removed from the dead code removal too.<p>Now Closure (at Google) meant a couple of different things (by 2010+). First it was the compiler. But second it was a set of components, many UI related. Fun fact: the Gmail did had written their own set of components (called Fava IIRC) and those had a different component lifecycle so weren&#x27;t interoperable. All of this was the most Google thing ever.<p>IMHO Closure was never heavily pushed by Google. In fact, at the time, publicly at least, Google was very much pushing GWT (Google Web Toolkit) instead. For those unfamiliar, this is writing code in Java that is transpiled to Javascripit for frontend code. This was based on the very Google notion of both not understanding and essentially resenting Javsscript. It was never viewed as a &quot;real&quot; language. Then again, the C++ people didn&#x27;t view Java as a real language either so there was a hierarchy.<p>GWT obviously never went anywhere and there were several other Javascript intiatives that never reached mass adoption (eg Angular and, later, Dart). Basically, React came out and everything else just died.<p>But this idea of running the same code everywhere was really destructive, distracting and counter-productive. Most notably, Google runs on protobufs. Being a binary format, this doesn&#x27;t work for Javascript. Java API protobufs weren&#x27;t compatible with GWT for many years. JS had a couple of encodings it tried to use. One was pblite, which basically took the protobuf tag numbers as array elements. Some Google protobufs had thousands of optional fields so the wire format became:<p><pre><code>    [null,null,null,null,...many times over...,null,&quot;foo&quot;]
</code></pre>
Not exactly efficient. Another used protobuf tag numbers as JSON object keys. I think this had other issues but I can&#x27;t remember what.<p>Likewise, Google never focused on having a good baseline set of components. Around this time some Twitter engineers came out with Bootstrap, which became the new reset.css plus a component library and everything else kind of died.<p>Even Angular&#x27;s big idea of two-way data binding came at a huge cost (component transclusion anyone?).<p>Google just never got the Web. The biggest product is essentially a text box. The way I always described it is &quot;How do you know you&#x27;re engineering if you&#x27;re not over-engineering?&quot; Google does some absolutely amazing technical infrastructure (in particular) but the Web? It just never seemed to be taken seriously or it was forced into an uncomfortable box.</div><br/><div id="37699471" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37699471" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tedunangst</span><span>|</span><a href="#37699258">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37699379">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37700082">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37699471">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37699471">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The whole time I read this article I kept thinking there was some write it in Java and compile to JS angle that wasn&#x27;t being mentioned.

This is DESPITE coming out with 2 of the greatest JS applications ever -- GMail and Google Maps -- which basically started &quot;Web 2.0&quot; in JS<p>I always found that odd, and I do think it was cultural.  At a certain point, low-level systems programming became valued more, and IMO it was emphasized&#x2F;rewarded too much over products.  I also agree that GWT seemed to be more &quot;staffed&quot; and popular than Closure compiler.  There were a bunch of internal sites using GWT.<p>There was much more JS talent at Yahoo, Facebook, etc. -- and even eventually Microsoft!  Shocking... since early Google basically leap-frogged Microsoft&#x27;s hotmail and I think maps with their JS-based products.  Google Docs&#x2F;Sheets&#x2F;Slides was supposedly a very strategic JS-based product to compete with Microsoft.<p>I believe a lot of it had to do with the interview process, which was very uniform for all the time I was there.  You could never really hire a JS specialist -- they had to be a generalist and answer systems programming questions.  I think there&#x27;s a sound logic in that (JS programmers need to understand systems performance), but I also think there&#x27;s room for diversity on a team.  People can learn different skills from each other; not everyone has to jump through the same hoops<p>---<p>This also reminds me that I thought Alex Russell wrote something about Google engineering not getting the WEB!  Not just JavaScript.  It&#x27;s not this, but maybe something similar:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;changelog.com&#x2F;jsparty&#x2F;263" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;changelog.com&#x2F;jsparty&#x2F;263</a><p>I don&#x27;t remember if it was an internal or external doc.  I think it focused on Chrome side things.<p>But I remember thinking that too -- the C++ guys don&#x27;t get the web.  When I was in indexing, I remember the tech lead (Sitaram) encouraged the engineers to actually go buy a web hosting account, and set up a web site !!  Presumably because that would get them more in touch with web tech, and how web sites are structured.<p>So yeah it seems really weird and ironic that the company that owns the biggest web apps and the most popular web browser has a lot of employees who don&#x27;t value that tech<p>---<p>Similarly, I have a rant about Google engineering not getting Python.  The early engineers set up some pretty great Python infrastructure, and then it kind of rotted.  There were arguably sound reasons for that, but I think it basically came back to bite the company with machine learning.<p>I&#x27;ve heard a bunch of complaints that the Tensorflow APIs are basically what a non-Python programmer would invent, and so PyTorch is more popular ... that&#x27;s sort of second-hand, but I believe it, from what I know about the engineering culture.<p>A lot of it has to do with Blaze&#x2F;Bazel, which is a great C++ build system, while users of every other language all find it deoptimizes their workflow (Java, Go, Python, JS, ...)<p>So basically I think in the early days there were people who understood JS (like paul) and understood Python, and wrote great code with them, but the eng culture shifted away from those languages.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="37700212" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37700212" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jwr</span><span>|</span><a href="#37699258">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37698574">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37700212">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37700212">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve been using the Google Closure compiler for the last 8 years or so, in production.

Internally at Microsoft, Script# was being used by some large teams. It let them use C# directly instead of JavaScript, but as a result, suffered from the kind of impedance mismatch you get when trying to stand at arms length from the runtime model you are really programming against. And there was Google’s Closure Compiler, which offered a rich type system embedded in comments inside JavaScript code to guide some advanced minification processes (and along the way, caught and reported type-related errors). And finally, this was the timeframe of a rapid ascendancy of CoffeeScript within the JavaScript ecosystem — becoming the first heavily used transpiled-to-JavaScript language and paving the way for transpilers in the JavaScript development workflow. (Aside — I often explained TypeScript in the early days using an analogy “CoffeeScript : TypeScript :: Ruby : C#&#x2F;Java&#x2F;C++”, often adding — “and there are 50x more C#&#x2F;Java&#x2F;C++ developers than Ruby developers :-)”)<p>&gt; What we quickly discovered we wanted to offer was a “best of all worlds” at the intersection of these three — a language as close as possible to JavaScript semantics (like CoffeeScript) and syntax (like Closure Compiler) but able to offer typechecking and rich tooling (like Script#).</div><br/><div id="37699479" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37699479" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">yellowviking</span><span>|</span><a href="#37698574">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37695208">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37699479">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37699479">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Excel online at last back in 2015 was writing in script#.

It could do great things, but it had the dependency on closure tools, which were not the easiest to use outside of Google (did anyone outside google actually use the `goog.*` stuff?) and writing annotation files (externs) of libraries and such never caught on and weren&#x27;t shared in some meaningful way.<p>- Lacked evangelism. I imagine this had to do with the above. There weren&#x27;t people from Google singing the benefits loud and proud everywhere about using the Closure Compiler<p>- Docs weren&#x27;t the best. Some parts are still broken (links and such).<p>- It didn&#x27;t evolve. Closure <i>could have</i> been a pretty great bundler too, actually, but it didn&#x27;t support ESM for a long time and it was never clear how to get it bundle things even when it did, I think you mostly had to declare each dependency file for it to work correctly, but I never myself got it to work 100%<p>These are some of the things that I think ended up holding it back. It could have been a cool little ecosystem too. There was a sister project called Closure Stylesheets that was for CSS that was supposedly very good as well, though I think thats no longer maintained. I believe it was very similar to how people use PostCSS in terms of what it did<p>[0]: Lots of projects use it to minify their JS but never really took advantage of the advanced functionality it can provide on top.</div><br/><div id="37697872" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37697872" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ng12</span><span>|</span><a href="#37695208">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37697339">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37697872">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37697872">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I used the goog.* stuff once upon a time.

It happily compiled heaps of incorrect code patterns without any warnings. Many JS devs had no prior experience with statically typed languages, and they saw it as an improvement over the status quo of plain JS, and didn&#x27;t care enough about slightly better but newer and thus less popular alternatives like Flow.
