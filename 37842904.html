And cost around $5&#x2F;month to run.<p>(This superior capability was not only useful in general for our services, but I understand it helped with cold enterprise sales approaches, from a tiny startup, e.g., maybe something like: &quot;Here&#x27;s an analysis of impact of X to your brand, based on data we monitor with some of our technology.  Would love to discuss with you.&quot;)<p>Controlling and understanding the software also gave us the flexibility to add capability quickly, as soon we had a need.  For example, since the problems we were addressing were global, as soon as we needed to be able to see what different geopolitical instances of that marketplace were showing to shoppers from those same geopolitical areas, I was able to implement scraping of that.<p>This was remarkably stable&#x2F;resilient over time, as well.  The biggest risk I perceived was something  I warned the team about: &quot;The first rule of Scrape Club is: <i>Don&#x27;t Talk About Scrape Club.</i>&quot;  I didn&#x27;t want to get on the radar of the marketplace&#x27;s lawyers, given that they were profiting from counterfeits and gray market, and possibly have public information turn into something that burns up the remainder of our meager Covid-time runway on lawyer billable hours.  (Having data get cut off due to lawyers also seems a risk if using a vendor for the data.)<p>Of course, there are often good reasons to buy data dumps&#x2F;feeds.  Just giving an example of when it wasn&#x27;t the best choice.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37852243" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37852243" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">daft_pink</span><span>|</span><a href="#37852729">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37852306">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37852243">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37852243">[7 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">My experience is that many people want to buy scraped data that is against a large website&#x27;s TOS such as Google, Amazon or Craigslist and the act of selling that data directly in a marketplace is likely to draw legal action from these companies as it&#x27;s someone else&#x27;s copyrighted data. Most companies that want you to scrape their data provide an api or would at least be willing to sell you the data or sell you access to an api.<p>That&#x27;s why people simply hire people, rent out proxies and store the data in their own internal databases, because then the companies have to figure out who the source of the scraping is and be able to prove it, which isn&#x27;t a lucrative target for the scraping companies.<p>That being said, there are clear examples of companies that sell processed data that&#x27;s been analyzed by data analysts and isn&#x27;t the raw scraped data and they have successful and lucrative business models.</div><br/><div id="37852304" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37852304" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">ggm</span><span>|</span><a href="#37852243">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37853664">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37852304">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37852304">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; <i>My experience is that many people want to buy scraped data that is against a large website&#x27;s TOS such as Google, Amazon or Craigslist and the act of selling that data directly in a marketplace is likely to draw legal action from these companies as it&#x27;s someone else&#x27;s copyrighted data.</i><p>I came here to make substantively the same point. Scraping for your own personal use and re-use as a derived product is reasonably cool but can border into IPR concerns. Scraping to re-sell as a product, thats really stepping over a line.<p>This has been a problem since the days of the yellow pages phonebook. There are rules around when a catalog is in the public domain, page contents with data I don&#x27;t think cross into the &quot;its ok to just copy and resell&quot; space.<p>I scrape several sources. World population and GDP stats are highly useful but finding good canonical sources was hard for a while there. I now use a Python API provided by the world bank, for most of them. Now I just have the problem that by economy, the inputs span 2019-2022 and I can&#x27;t get a single authority for population estimates right &quot;now&quot; worldwide. But, scraping to resell that? I think it would be wrong.</div><br/><div id="37852487" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37852487" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bloppe</span><span>|</span><a href="#37852243">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37852304">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37853664">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37852487">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37852487">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Scraping internet data is perfectly fine and legal.

If for example its brokering access to the page specific structure in some meta notation and you as a consumer scrape direct? thats actually quite cool. If its running a cache of the data re-presented in JSON form for you to consume, or monetising an Elastic Stack of the data and you read it from them?
