There has to be a relative surplus, more food than not, less time for survival only, to make tools work.<p>We believe in abundance because of millennia of life experience  incorrectly or not.<p>In modern times, most scarcity problems are supply chain not actual exhaustion, diamond mines and gold not withstanding.

The reason why many bad choices have been possible is that the costs for most chemical elements that are included in a product are fake, they include only the smaller cost for mining, processing and transportation before the product is made, without adding the greater costs that would be needed for the recovery of the element from an end-of-life product and for repairing the environmental damage caused by its mining.<p>The payment of these extra costs has been pushed into the future, when someone else will have to pay them, instead of the users of the elements mined now.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36874246" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36874246" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">hallqv</span><span>|</span><a href="#36874176">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36874475">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36874705">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36874246">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36874246">[6 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Moderating optimism is overrated.

The species wasn&#x27;t permanently on the brink of starvation such that they didn&#x27;t have time to bend down and pick up a stick and use it to add to a shelter or throw at an animal, so in the very literal extreme sense we carry a surplus of energy with us. But the equation isn&#x27;t necessarily much different between one person dividing their time between making tools and hunting, and a division over a slightly larger group. Efficiency improvements with primitive tools would have been large and quite immediate. Also people would have obvious and immediate specializations before any formal organization. Some would be faster, some stronger, some better climbers, some better at sharpening sticks. So there wouldn&#x27;t have to be some significant build up of a surplus before pretty sophisticated tool making and division of labor would emerge, IMO.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36874637" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36874637" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">jojobas</span><span>|</span><a href="#36874176">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#36874689">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36874451">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36874637">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36874637">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Up until the Neolithic Revolution human population was stable, before that people were venturing out to hostile lands in search for food, as populated land couldn&#x27;t carry any more.<p>Infanticide as a population control measure was the norm, early Australian explorers recorded about 30% of children being killed and&#x2F;or eaten business as usual.

The planetary energy budget is even less of an issue.<p>For the latter, we have fission, fusion and we can grow into space.<p>For the former: in principle you can create arbitrarily large economic value on arbitrarily small energy budgets (if you have enough time).  Getting a bit philosophical and speculative:<p>Assume computation is one way to create economic value.  Eg either because computation is just useful for humans, like today, or because in the future you&#x27;ll be able to simulate human beings (or other economic actors) directly via computation.  Landauer&#x27;s Principle [0] gives us a physical lower limit on the amount of energy we need to do a single bit operation:<p>E &gt;= k * T * ln 2<p>(where k is the Boltzmann constant).<p>Stripping away all the constants, this tells us that as the universe expands and cools off, computation gets cheaper.  The absolute minimum cost of computation is proportional to the ambient temperature of the universe.<p>As a simple example, you can get an infinite amount of computation out of a single Joule, if you wait for the temperature to half between each operation.<p>Of course, in practice we are far, far away from the Landauer limit being relevant.
