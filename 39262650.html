Then convince them to work as many hours as possible for their fixed salary, plus the carrot of a bonus payout every once in a while if everyone bills lots of hours.<p>Having that developer spend any time working on the company&#x27;s product causes all sort of problems. The most immediate is the loss of revenue.  But also now this employee might see working on the product as cutting into their bonus since they are billing less hours.  Everyone wants some of the upside if the side product generates revenue but how do you split it between people who worked directly on the product and people who worked on paying client jobs to generate the revenue so the others could work on the product? It ends up causing a rift.<p>The other thing I&#x27;ve seen while working at small and even medium sized consultancies is that they end up dependent on one large customer who calls all the shots and takes up all the available time, or all &quot;extra&quot; time not being billed is used working on sales for the next contract.

Clearly there is no such thing as &quot;most orgs&quot;, as there are many different kinds of businesses and how they approach solving problems varies from business to business. Their use of technology to solve problems also can&#x27;t be easily reduced; the way the business chooses to solve problems doesn&#x27;t necessarily dictate what technology they should use.<p>It correlates the need for complexity with whether an organization is in some 20% minority of organizations, as if only a minority of orgs should or shouldn&#x27;t use a complex tool.<p>It reduces a given tool down to &quot;complex or not&quot;, as if complexity is the only consideration of whether to use a tool or not. There may be many different reasons to use a tool regardless of whether it&#x27;s complex.<p>It assumes that a given tool has some inherent complexity that isn&#x27;t comparable to other tools. Other tools might have less inherent complexity, but their lack of complexity may then create new problems that have to be solved, which just moves the complexity from the tool to a bunch of other places.<p>Overall, it correlates the way you solve problems, with how complex a tool is, with whether your organization is of one of two large generic groups.

That&#x27;s what Snyk did and they&#x27;ve been killing it, reaching $7B valuation as of last year. Both the company I was advising and Weave.works decided to stick to the developer productivity story and unfortunately both have now shut down. There are many factors to a company&#x27;s success but it doesn&#x27;t help to be positioned as a solution that&#x27;s seen as just a &quot;nice-to-have&quot; or part of a &quot;best practice.&quot;</div><br/><div id="39267839" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39267839" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">marcinzm</span><span>|</span><a href="#39264232">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39267014">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39269241">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39267839">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39267839">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve been thinking about this for a bit.<p>Productivity is a hard sell for a company that is tech focused. Since a client basically can&#x27;t measure the impact there is little external difference between a true solution and a fake solution. As a result even if you convince someone of the value a company that focuses on marketing to those paying the bills will win out against one that focused on building a better product.<p>Security has fairly proscriptive compliance requirements (ie: SOC, etc.) which provide a benchmark against which to measure impact.
