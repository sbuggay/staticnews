If you live in an area prone to tornadoes and you &quot;have no warning&quot;, then you&#x27;re just not paying attention. We know tornadoes exist. We know where they tend to frequently occur. The local weather stations in those areas are pretty damn good with warnings. We know days ahead of time that the conditions will be right for potential activity. We can now see potential tornadoes before they are formed. We can track their paths with neighborhood cross street precision.<p>Nevermind the fact that there&#x27;s a pretty good indicator when the sky turns dark and the weather changes. Thunder and lightning and wind are essentially the knocking on the door. It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s a sunny day and a tornado just pops out of the sky to say hello.<p>To say no warning just means they are not paying attention.

We don&#x27;t usually see tornadoes, and I don&#x27;t think they were very big, so maybe that changes things.<p>One went a couple of blocks to the north of me.  The tornado watch came out the day before so I was paying attention.  I was standing on the porch watching in that direction.  It was storming, but it wasn&#x27;t a very strong storm.  No green, no hail, no strong winds, rain was pretty average.  Still didn&#x27;t know until I started hearing about it through Twitter and a coworker.  The warning came 10-15 minutes after he saw it.<p>The other storm that dropped a tornado went over us while we were at a park.  It was sunny when we arrived ~20 minutes earlier.  This one did have all of the classic signs - winds picked up out of nowhere, heavy rain, hail, etc.  At least it made sense when we heard a tornado touched down.<p>Maybe it IS a weak argument, but I&#x27;ve seen dozens of tornado warnings where no tornado occurs.  There are weeks where a severe t-storm watch is out 4-5 nights and it doesn&#x27;t rain.  Sometimes a severe t-storm warning comes out and it doesn&#x27;t rain.  It&#x27;s really easy to start ignoring them.  I even see winter storm warnings that fizzle out to a couple of inches of snow.

I have mixed feelings about the &quot;tornado sirens&quot; being used for hail&#x2F;severe weather without a tornado. I lean towards it being a good idea.

The problem is that in certain areas, the tornado watches are occurring ALL the time and you can&#x27;t stop every time there is one.<p>So, yeah, in hindsight everyone saw it coming. But no one thinks THIS time will actually be the time so it does sneak up on people. My father recent went to bed during a tornado warning and one touched down less than a mile away. He got lucky.

A lot of (primarily young) people can hear frequencies outside that range. I can still hear a sine wave down to about 14Hz, and I&#x27;m not sure if the limit is from my ears or the audio interface that&#x27;s only rated down to 20Hz.<p>I can imagine &quot;feeling&quot; 1Hz from a big subwoofer, but it&#x27;s hard to imagine what actually hearing 1Hz would be like. I wouldn&#x27;t rule it out, though.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="38634723" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38634723" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">remyp</span><span>|</span><a href="#38635954">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38633308">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38634723">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38634723">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">As a lifelong midwesterner I don’t need sirens, the internet, TV, radio, or low frequency sound to warn me about a tornado.
