Just look at the way the wooly mammoths connect with the ground, and their lumbering mass feels real.<p>Motion-capture works fine because that&#x27;s real motion, but every time people try to animate humans and animals, even in big-budget CGI movies, it&#x27;s always ultimately obviously fake. There are so many subtle things that happen in terms of acceleration and deceleration of all of the different parts of an organism, that no animator ever gets it 100% right. No animation <i>algorithm</i> gets it to a point where it&#x27;s believable, just where it&#x27;s &quot;less bad&quot;.<p>But these videos seem to be getting it entirely believable for both people and animals. Which is <i>wild</i>.<p>And then of course, not to mention that these are entirely believable 3D spaces, with seemingly full object permanence.

Pop, Hip Hop, and EDM basically all are put together as being nearly computer perfect.<p>All the great producers can play instruments, and that&#x27;s often times the best way to get a section out initially.

The announcement mentions this several times.<p>The OpenAI blog post lists &quot;Archeologists discover a generic plastic chair in the desert, excavating and dusting it with great care.&quot; as one of the &quot;failed&quot; cases.
But this (and &quot;Reflections in the window of a train traveling through the Tokyo suburbs.&quot;) seem to me to be 2 of the most important examples.<p>- In the Tokyo one, the model is smart enough to figure out that on a train, the reflection would be of a passenger, and the passenger has Asian traits since this is Tokyo.
- In the chair one, OpenAI says the model failed to model the physics of the object (which hints that it did try to, which is not how the early diffusion models worked ; they just tried to generate &quot;plausible&quot; images). And we can see one of the archeologists basically chasing the chair down to grab it, which does correctly model the interaction with a floating object.<p>I think we can&#x27;t underestimate how crucial that is to the building of a general model that has a strong model of the world. Not just a &quot;theory of mind&quot;, but a litteral understanding of &quot;what will happen next&quot;, independently of &quot;what would a human say would happen next&quot; (which is what the usual text-based models seem to do).<p>This is going to be much more important, IMO, than the video aspect.</div><br/><div id="39393737" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39393737" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bamboozled</span><span>|</span><a href="#39388585">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39390303">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39393737">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39393737">[4 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Wouldn&#x27;t having a good understanding of physics mean you know that a women doesn&#x27;t slide down the road when she walks?

The congruency however needs to extend to more than 2 generations. If a single scene is composed of multiple shots, then those multiple shots need to be part of the same world the scene is being shot in.
If you check the video with the title `A beautiful homemade video showing the people of Lagos, Nigeria in the year 2056. Shot with a mobile phone camera.` the surroundings do not seem to make sense as the view starts with a market, spirals around a point and then ends with a bridge which does not fit into the market. 
If the the different shots generated the model did fit together seamlessly, trying to make the fit together is where the difficulty comes in. However I do not have any experience in video editing, so it&#x27;s just speculation.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="39393411" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39393411" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">esafak</span><span>|</span><a href="#39386309">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#39388799">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#39389414">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39389740">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39393411">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39393411">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The CGI industry is about to be turned upside down.

But looking into their technical paper, it is evident that they are benefiting from their own body of work done in the past and also the enormous resources available to them.<p>For instance, the generational leap in video generation capability of SORA may be possible because:<p>1. Instead of resizing, cropping, or trimming videos to a standard size, Sora trains on data at its native size. This preserves the original aspect ratios and improves composition and framing in the generated videos. This requires massive infrastructure. This is eerily similar to how GPT3 benefited from a blunt approach of throwing massive resources at a problem rather than extensively optimizing the architecture, dataset, or pre-training steps.<p>2. Sora leverages the re-captioning technique from DALL-E 3 by leveraging GPT to turn short user prompts into longer detailed captions that are sent to the video model. Although it remains unclear whether they employ GPT-4 or another internal model, it stands to reason that they have access to a superior captioning model compared to others.<p>This is not to say that inertia and resources are the only factors that is differentiating OpenAI, they may have access to much better talent pool but that is hard to gauge from the outside.</div><br/></div></div><div id="39388678" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-39388678" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">neutralx</span><span>|</span><a href="#39392504">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#39386469">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-39388678">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-39388678">[16 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Has anyone else noticed the leg swap in Tokyo video at 0:14.

This also helps explain why the model is so good since it is trained to simulate the real world, as opposed to imitate the pixels.<p>More importantly, its capabilities suggest AGI and general robotics could be closer than many think (even though some key weaknesses remain and further improvements are necessary before the goal is reached.)<p>EDIT: I just saw this relevant comment by an expert at Nvidia:<p><pre><code>   “If you think OpenAI Sora is a creative toy like DALLE, ... think again. Sora is a data-driven physics engine. It is a simulation of many worlds, real or fantastical. The simulator learns intricate rendering, &quot;intuitive&quot; physics, long-horizon reasoning, and semantic grounding, all by some denoising and gradient maths.

   I won&#x27;t be surprised if Sora is trained on lots of synthetic data using Unreal Engine 5. It has to be!

Having the best product and being able to maintain that best-in-class product status over time through a firm&#x27;s &#x27;internal capabilities&#x27; is very much <i>a</i> moat and a strong one at that. A moat is the business strategy sense is anything that enables a firm to maintain competitive advantage.

New technologies are usually bad at substituting for things that already exist. It&#x27;s 100% true this will not substitute for the existing genre of film and video.<p>New technologies change the economics of how we satisfy our needs.<p>When search engines became good, many pundits confidently predicted Google would never replace librarians or libraries. It didn&#x27;t. It shifted our relationship to knowledge; instead of having to employ an expert in looking things up, we all had to become experts at sifting through a flood of info.<p>When the cost of producing art-directed and realistic video goes to zero it&#x27;s hard to predict what&#x27;s going to happen. Obviously the era of video = veracity is now over. And you can get the equivalent of Martin Scorsese and a million dollar budget to do the video instructions for a hair dryer. Instead of hunting for a gif to express how you feel, captured from an existing TV show or something, you could create a scene on the fly and attach it to a text message. Or maybe you dispense with text messages altogether. Maybe text is only for talking to computers now.<p>My personal prediction is that the value of a degree in art history is going to go way, way up, because they&#x27;ll be the best prompt engineers.
