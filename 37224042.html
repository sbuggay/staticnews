It&#x27;s really hard to render consistently if the underlying drivers are all wonk and proprietary.<p>I am curious to see how this plays out. In my mind, there are two options:<p>1. Apple conforms to the existing standards of OpenGL and Vulkan we see gaining steam for many film and game production pipelines.<p>2. Apple tries to throw its weight around and force devs to support their Metal standards even more, ultimately hoping to force the world onto Metal + macOS.<p>My heart hopes for option 1, but my gut tells me Apple is going to push for option 2 with all the might it can muster. In my experience, Apple doesn&#x27;t like any standards it doesn&#x27;t control with an iron fist (not really saying much about Apple here though... nVidia, Autodesk, Adobe, and Microsoft are all the same).<p>The next couple of years are going to be interesting for sure!</div><br/><div id="37226520" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37226520" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gumby</span><span>|</span><a href="#37226366">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37226605">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37226520">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37226520">[60 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; In my experience, Apple doesn&#x27;t like any standards it doesn&#x27;t control with an iron fist<p>I would add some nuance to this statement: &quot;Apple likes open standards when it is weak.&quot;<p>The iMac and early OS X went big on open standards, and Jobs made a point of pointing this out: USB for the iMac, JPEG, MPG, mp3, Postscript etc for OSX.

GPU training is RDMA heavy and this is a place where both NvLink and Infiniband shine, ethernet much less so. Retransmissions are very bad, in global-performance-terms, for ROCEv2 transfers. Right now Nvidia is just crushing it and there&#x27;s zero chance anyone is going to catch up by introducing new Infiniband ASICs.<p>So what happens? You have a consortium spun up by all of the companies in the Ethernet space - Ultra Ethernet Consortium - to try and use &quot;standards&quot; to push back on customers who don&#x27;t want to make big investments in &quot;non-standard.&quot; UEC is pretty vague but seems to be promising Broadcom-style cellized fabrics, the whole point of which is to have an ethernet-like standard that avoids ECMP-induced flow collisions and retransmissions - that is, get Ethernet into the same territory as Infiniband.<p>If you look back in time in the tech industry, you see this over and over and over and over. Standards are great, they make certain kinds of multi-sided markets and markets that need broad participation to be viable possible - but they are also routinely about the losers joining together to compete.</div><br/><div id="37233199" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37233199" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">michh</span><span>|</span><a href="#37226366">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37227058">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37227667">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37233199">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37233199">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Right now Nvidia is just crushing it and there&#x27;s zero chance anyone is going to catch up by introducing new Infiniband ASICs.<p>I mean, Cornelis Networks is trying with the resurrected OmniPath.

Alphabet seemingly employs somewhere between 20-40 thousand engineers, and it is their labor that produced all (?) of their revenue generating products.

Application support is limited, but hopefully with Intel&#x27;s backing, the situation would gradually improve. Meanwhile, Vulkan Compute sidesteps the entire headache with compute shaders. But I&#x27;m not familiar with it in terms of application support.<p>SYCL can be implemented on top of OpenCL and OpenCL&#x27;s SPIR-V extension. It soon turned out that this route is unfeasible due to prevalent vendor lock-in that&#x27;s not going to change anytime soon, so it has largely been abandoned by everyone else but Intel and Mesa. Right now SYCL is usually implemented by backends to GPU vendor&#x27;s respective APIs, like ROCm, HIP or CUDA. Doing the same for Metal would be very challenging.<p>Mesa already has experimental support of OpenCL w&#x2F; SPIR-V on Intel and AMDGPU, so theoretically it can be extended to Apple Silicon. Difficulty of implementing OpenCL&#x27;s SPIR-V extension should be comparable with Vulkan compute shader (which also uses SPIR-V). However, currently OpenCL on Apple Silicon is entirely unsupported.

A lot of the complaints about XPS hardware really boil down to the bad set of drivers Dell ships them with.

They&#x27;re locked into that ecosystem with various purchases and don&#x27;t want to throw that away.  They use a Mac and like the integration.<p>On top of that, I (as an Android user) am constantly uncomfortable running a mobile OS built by a company that exists mainly to track people&#x27;s behavior and invade their privacy, with the goal of selling ads (and I am more vehemently anti-advertising than most people).  As much as I don&#x27;t fully buy &quot;Apple&#x27;s commitment to privacy&quot;, they are in a much better place in that regard than Android is.  I lock my phone down and give nearly every app (including Google&#x27;s) zero permissions, and only enable (and then immediately disable[0]) as necessary, but I&#x27;m still convinced my privacy posture would probably be better with an iPhone.

Is there painstaking probing to find different addresses&#x2F;states between a Max and an Ultra?  The M2 Ultra has two GPU variants (60-core and 72-core), although the Pro and Max also have GPU count variants.  Are those transparent from this OpenGL driver&#x27;s point of view?

That means that they can iterate very fast with flagrant disregard for backwards compatiblity (I don&#x27;t necessarily mean that in a negative way, it can be great for development&#x2F;progress), and it means that any changes they make have to be reverse engineered by setting debug breakpoints, examining state, signals, etc to try and figure out what they changed and how it works now.
