They don&#x27;t store any contact information that could be used to warn customers, so my connection mysteriously failed one day and I was left with several months of prepaid service.<p>I&#x27;m a bit bitter for that, but honestly their technical writing and security decisions have earned enough good will from me that I want them to keep the money.

I expect those of our customers who relied on this feature to be disappointed by its removal as well as the manner in which it was done.<p>Nevertheless it was the right thing to do. The manner and extent in which it came to be abused in recent months made it unacceptable for us to continue providing it. This feature should have been removed a long time ago, with a longer grace period. It wasn&#x27;t - a mistake on our part - and some of our users suffered for it, including you. For this I am sorry.<p>Affected customers can get their money back for any prepaid service they can not use, of course.<p>If you used port forwarding to (I) make a service reachable (II) from the open Internet there are plenty of good hosting providers which will happily take your business.<p>If you used port forwarding to (III) stay anonymous while (I) making a service reachable we can highly recommend Tor&#x27;s &quot;onion service&quot; feature. It was built with that use case in mind.<p>If you used port forwarding to (III) stay anonymous while (I) making a service reachable (II) from the open Internet, there are no good options that we can recommend.<p>Port forwarding needed to be removed on moral grounds. It needed to be removed because it was causing too much of a disturbance to our core mission of making mass surveillance and censorship ineffective.<p>I hope my explanation has - if not allayed your disappointment - at least provided some clarity.<p>Best regards,

What makes Mullvad&#x27;s situation different? Is it a question of margins for high traffic port forwarding users (Mullvad is branching out in browsers and search while these two are not) or something else? I used to be a long time user and a huge fan and proponent of Mullvad&#x27;s but the communication here has been very much opaque. This is especially so as port forwarding removal was announced straight after a raid where police, after Mullvad&#x27;s explanations, didn&#x27;t take anything [2].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.azirevpn.com&#x2F;port-forwarding&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.azirevpn.com&#x2F;port-forwarding&#x2F;</a>

This year it became clear that we had become popular for use cases we didn&#x27;t want to support. Undesirable content and malicious services is a good summary. I&#x27;m not privy to more details than that as my main focus is research.<p>Technology is often a double-edged sword, but thankfully it is often also a net benefit to its users and society in general. Privacy online is exactly that kind of technology. Enabling anyone to host any service anonymously on the open Internet is another matter.<p>I hope AirVPN and AzireVPN somehow succeed with providing that feature while steering clear of its downsides.

That clarifies :) I&#x27;m also glad for all the innovations Mullvad has invented&#x2F;supported&#x2F;etc in the VPN space -- anonymous account numbers, multi-server SOCKS proxies, Wireguard over TCP, post-quantum Wireguard, stboot, open APIs, the list goes on.<p>It feels like VPN for apps is very different than a VPN for browsing. While in both cases I want my traffic to be mixed in with a lot of other people&#x27;s traffic (so service provider dealing with complaints about neighbors is part of the value proposition), browsing use case is tied to IP reputation (so don&#x27;t want someone to run a Tor exit on the same IP), whereas the app use case is much less IP reputation-sensitive but definitely benefits from port forwarding (e.g. to anonymously run nodes that powers distributed infrastructure like crypto).<p>I&#x27;d definitely pay premium, with longer commitments up front for &quot;this server might be useless for browsing but run all your anonymous crypto nodes behind forwarded ports&quot; type of service. Maybe if port forwarding is active only if you have 6+ months of outstanding service commitment (and you forfeit the balance if your port gets used for C&amp;C or whatnot) is enough of a deterrent. Some VPNs are doing some traffic segregation already, e.g. having dedicated servers for P2P, though nothing exactly like this.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37064125" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37064125" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">capableweb</span><span>|</span><a href="#37061460">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37063851">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37066446">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37066986">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37064125">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37064125">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">It seems pretty evident why they had to turn it off:<p>&gt; The manner and extent in which it came to be abused in recent months made it unacceptable for us to continue providing it.<p>Probably the difference between Mullvad and AirVPN&#x2F;AzireVPN is how popular the service is, which also usually dictates how popular it is for people to try to abuse it.<p>Maybe 1% of each service&#x27;s traffic is abuse, which for AirVPN&#x2F;AzireVPN is not that much, but on Mullvads scale it becomes a whole nother beast.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37066986" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37066986" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">Victor1024</span><span>|</span><a href="#37061460">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37063851">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37064125">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37063052">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37066986">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37066986">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Mullvad is probably the VPN with the longest track record of not keeping logs.

The facts given are that Proton has an official legal entity in Lithuania called PROTONVPN LT, UAB, and another company called Tesonet shared Lithuanian offices and apparently some business services with them. The article claims that Tesonet is a &quot;data mining company&quot; based on the following evidence:<p>&gt; Tesonet has its hands in “Machine Learning Solution, cybersecurity, and collection of business intelligence data” in efforts to create algorithms, that best suit their client business needs. If you read their about page, the company openly states it employs many different technologies to structure data, which is run on various services like MySQL, Anisble, collectd, StatsD, ElasticSearch, Grafana, Influx DB, Python, and Couchbase.<p>&gt; ALL of these names rely on HEAVY USER INFORMATION, which makes sense, considering that Tesonet is a DATA MINING company. Now, let us not forget that Lithuania itself is a NATO member that regularly holds NAZI marches.<p>Let&#x27;s just say that I&#x27;m not immediately convinced that Tesonet is in the business of selling user data.<p>The article also claims that in one online Lithuanian business services directory, the CEO of Tesonet was listed as the head of PROTONVPN LT, UAB. I have no idea of the legitimacy of this claim, but it stretches plausibility to claim that Proton is secretly not a Swiss company and secretly has a Lithuanian data mining company CEO as its head.<p>The article then goes on to make some completely unsupported allegations: &quot;the real question is not whether ProtonVPN is working with Tesonet, but if the provider is owned by the data mining company&quot; and &quot;Under the name of a FREE VPN service, they’ve been collecting USER DATA all along.&quot;<p>Furthermore, the original source of most of this information actually comes from a Hacker News comment. The article links to a comment by the head of Private Internet Access! <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=17258203">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=17258203</a><p>Unfortunately this gives the game away, because the comment is &quot;retracted and removed by author&#x27;s request&quot;. Dang comments:<p>&gt; In addition to the redacting the above comment, we deleted several comments below by request of their authors. My understanding is that the dispute has been resolved and that the allegations are retracted.<p>In other words, it appears to me that the true source of these rumors has retracted them and no longer believes that Proton has the claimed ties to Tesonet.<p>Ironically, as a result of looking into this, I feel slightly <i>more</i> confident about ProtonVPN than I did previously.<p>Edited to add: you&#x27;re also stretching even the blog post&#x27;s unsupported allegations in your comment, when you say that ProtonVPN is &quot;white-labeled&quot; Nord. The article makes the unsupported insinuation that ProtonVPN and Nord are both owned by Tesonet, but this is different from the claim that ProtonVPN is just Nord repackaged as a different product, as you claim here.</div><br/><div id="37065596" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37065596" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">DANmode</span><span>|</span><a href="#37060967">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#37065064">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37061424">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37065596">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37065596">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; In other words, it appears to me that the true source of these rumors has retracted them and no longer believes that Proton has the claimed ties to Tesonet.<p>I was nodding along, until this.<p>Seeing someone retract a pretty specific claim like that by <i>calling on the admins to delete</i>, instead of leaving it up for posterity and&#x2F;or and discussing <i>how</i> they made the error, feels more like a legal threat was received, and some pants were shat.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="37061424" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37061424" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">buzzy_hacker</span><span>|</span><a href="#37060967">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37063724">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37063473">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37061424">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37061424">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I think those two are the most reputable VPNs.
