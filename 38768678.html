But there are a few problems with making software purely from ready-made building blocks. Here are two of them:<p>1) Much more often than not, the ready-made building blocks are crap. Your software will reflect that crappiness, and your life will consist not of writing software, but of maintaining and massaging crap.<p>2) Even if your ready-made building blocks are high-quality, they limit what kind of software you can write. Ideally, you imagine what you want your software to do, and then you write software to do it. You <i>create</i> the building blocks in that process. If you are only using ready-made building blocks, there is a lot of great software you just cannot write. And I think we all see that, because there isn&#x27;t much great software around.<p>These problems might not be a concern for you. If you write software that is pretty much just more of the same, 2) does not apply to you. And while 1) is still problematic, it will be just manageable because you use these building blocks mostly on their happy path.<p>But I have bad news for you. This kind of software will soon be written not by you, but by an AI.</div><br/><div id="38769761" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38769761" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">p-e-w</span><span>|</span><a href="#38768909">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38769670">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38769340">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38769761">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38769761">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; If you are only using ready-made building blocks, there is a lot of great software you just cannot write. And I think we all see that, because there isn&#x27;t much great software around.<p>I claim that the opposite is true: The reason there are so few software projects that are really great is because <i>high-level</i> skills, not low-level ones, are in short supply. Every CS graduate can implement Paxos. The number of people with the experience needed to take an implementation of Paxos, and many other components, and put them together into something that works <i>really</i> well is much, much smaller.<p>&gt; But I have bad news for you. This kind of software will soon be written not by you, but by an AI.<p>AI is actually <i>much</i> better at writing low-level code than high-level code. If you tell it to implement a piece table or a Fibonacci heap, it will do so without problems, in any language. If you tell it to create a simple CRUD application using existing libraries, it will output something that doesn&#x27;t actually work.</div><br/><div id="38769910" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38769910" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">auggierose</span><span>|</span><a href="#38768909">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#38769761">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38769340">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38769910">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38769910">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I guess it all depends on your definition of low-level. High-level can also be low-level, just with different building blocks, if the building blocks are based on well-specified abstractions.<p>I am actually currently writing a novel text editor, and I can guarantee you, my requirements mean that an AI cannot help me with that directly, because the underlying mechanisms I need don&#x27;t exist yet. The AI is still helpful though when researching existing mechanisms, and to pinpoint why they don&#x27;t work for me.<p>&gt; AI is actually much better at writing low-level code than high-level code.<p>&gt; If you tell it to create a simple CRUD application using existing libraries, it will output something that doesn&#x27;t actually work.<p>If your low-level code is just a copy or adaptation of something existing, then yes, AI is really good at that. Something novel though, AI cannot help you much here.<p>On the other hand, simple CRUD applications will all be done by AI very soon. Probably not using existing libraries though, because these are crap.<p>But there is certainly a role for humans currently in high-level design, I agree with you here. But this high-level design crucially relies on your ability for low-level design, with the ability to <i>imagine</i> and then implement (possibly with the help of AI) the building blocks you need, not just reuse the ones that are there.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="38769340" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38769340" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">tehnub</span><span>|</span><a href="#38768909">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38769670">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38769431">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38769340">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38769340">[11 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">This is like telling a student learning an instrument never to practice scales or études because there are other skills necessary for playing in an orchestra.

When I wrote a Game Gear emulator 26 years ago I used off-the-shelf CPU code and just mapped all the in&#x2F;out and did the graphics bits. Took me and a friend a single evening to get it happily playing games.<p>And OS is harder. Well, it was last time I wrote one, again about 26 or 27 years ago.
