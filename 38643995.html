Obviously the products of cognition that are easiest for us to understand are linguistic, because language is the primary standardized means by which we communicate.

When I see parents with kids I see them correcting their kids all the time, correcting misunderstandings or fixing pronunciations or grammar issues etc. You can notice that parents use a specific voice when they correct the pronunciation, and the kid gets that the parent tried to correct their pronunciation from it, that happens quite a lot with small kids.

The (weak) efficient markets hypothesis is enough to say the price reflects all the exogenous information that is available to the market about the stock so you don&#x27;t need all the fundamentals etc and there are lots of people who trade in that way.<p>The history of language models in computing is that research started by building very complex systems that attempted to encode &quot;how the world works&quot; by developing very intricate rule systems and build linguistic&#x2F;semantic models from there.  These &quot;expert systems&quot; tended towards being arcane and brittle and lacked the ability to reason outside their ruleset in general.

The database they used for training included software simulations (and real world data) that accounted for atomic (quantum) interactions. The 3D structure of proteins includes all the quantum interactions.<p>More generally, AI models (aka very large function graphs) are trained on tuples that represent mappings of inputs to outputs (input -&gt; output). The idea then is that whatever structure exists in those pairs&#x2F;tuples&#x2F;mappings is discovered by the training process with the help of gradient descent which tunes the parameters of the model&#x2F;graph to optimally compress the information contained in the data. This means the model must uncover the quantum effects (or some close proxy of it) and then encode them into the parameters in a way that makes compression&#x2F;prediction possible [1].<p>None of this is magic, compressing data requires uncovering structures and symmetries that can be used to reduce the size of the data and it turns out gradient descent with lots of parameters manages to do that for a large class of problems albeit at a very steep computational cost that requires billions of dollars for hardware and software (including nuclear power plants [2]).

We evolve, accumulate knowledge and being able to build more sophisticated machinery, or tame more complex processes to build more sophisticated things. Even bacteria transfers memories across generations.<p>However, this doesn&#x27;t remove the ceiling. Total human knowledge will always be larger and deeper than any A.I. we can create, because the upper limit is always what we can consciously manipulate and put into something. Your next car has the possibility to contain more technology, because we can build more complex factories to manufacture them. Yet, a car can&#x27;t be more complex&#x2F;sophisticated than its factory.<p>Consider a semiconductor fab. You can use the output of that fab to design&#x2F;create better fab, but the process needs human intervention. Invention of new things are generally necessary. Better processes, optics, hardware, etc.<p>Another nice example is reprap machines. A reprap can print all plastic parts required for the machine. You need to get metal parts yourself, and assemble them. If you want to be able to print metal parts, machine gets more complicated. So a reprap which can build itself completely is at least sophisticated as the resulting reprap itself, but you need to hand assemble it again.<p>If you want an assembling reprap, now that thing becomes a factory. Again, the complexity of the product is at most the same as the building machine. You can create better factories which has more streamlined processes, but the gap widens again. The factory becomes more complex than the output.<p>As a human, you&#x27;re the factory. Your upper limit is another human. You can create things more complex than a human by using multiple humans, but the creator ends up more complex than the creature itself.<p>You&#x27;re moving up the ceiling, that&#x27;s true, but everything we build is capped by our collective capacity. That&#x27;s the truth.<p>A.I. is glorified search.

It is an error to confuse the complexity of a specification of what kind of output you want, with the complexity of the process of producing that output. Getting superintelligent AI to understand simple specifications should be a non-issue. If anything, we would assume that it could be aligned using a specification of inferior quality to what a less intelligent AI would require, assuming that the superintelligent AI is better at inferring intentions.<p>If a little girl with no knowledge of cooking asks her dad to cook the macaroni extra crispy, his knowledge of how to do that isn&#x27;t a barrier to understanding what his daughter wants. A trained chef with even greater skills might even be able to execute her order more successfully. Superalignment is nothing less mundane than this.<p>Advances in AI will lead to more ambitious applications. As well as requiring more intelligent technology, these new applications may well require more detailed specifications to be inputed, but these two issues are pretty orthogonal. In traditional computing, it is already clear that simple specifications often require highly complex implementations, and that some simple computational processes lead to outputs whose properties are highly difficult to specify. Why wouldn&#x27;t the same apply in ML?</div><br/><div id="38651751" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38651751" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">edanm</span><span>|</span><a href="#38650694">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38650821">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38651751">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38651751">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; Getting superintelligent AI to understand simple specifications should be a non-issue.<p>Why would that be the case?<p>A big part of the worry around AI-alignment is exactly because this seems very hard when you try to do it. We are used to interacting with other humans, who implicitly share almost all our background assumptions when we communicate with them. The same is not the case for a computer program.<p>E.g. if you&#x27;re holding a basketball and tell you &quot;throw it to me&quot;, you implicitly understand that I mean to throw it:<p>1. To my hands, or to some area that makes it easy to catch it.<p>2. Throw it slowly enough that it arrives to me. Not strong enough to hurt me.<p>3. Not to try to bounce it off of something that will break on the way to me, even if it still arrives to me.<p>etc.<p>These are all background assumptions, and I know they&#x27;re hard to actually specify because smart people have spent twenty years trying to figure out the math to do this and <i>say</i> it&#x27;s hard.<p>Also, if you think those are contrived exampled - let&#x27;s note that the closest thing we have to building an AGI right now is just building software, in general. And I think I won&#x27;t shock anyone by saying that &quot;getting software to do what you want, without bugs&quot; is... hard. I think there are almost literally no software systems today that don&#x27;t have bugs in them.</div><br/></div></div><div id="38650821" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38650821" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">creer</span><span>|</span><a href="#38650694">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38651751">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38651363">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38650821">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38650821">[5 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">That&#x27;s a good part of the problem.
