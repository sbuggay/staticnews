That in itself wasn&#x27;t surprising, but the interesting point they talked about is that the game is much more enjoyable when played on PC with an emulated copy because modern gaming PC hardware is much smoother and higher resolution than the stock Switch.<p>It really makes me think Nintendo has an untapped market here to sell a little box you plug into your PC that plays switch games, interfaces with their controllers, etc.  They&#x27;ve done oddball stuff like the SNES Gameboy player and GameCube GBA player add-ons in the past.

With all their oddball stuff, you were still largely within the Nintendo ecosystem. They also probably don&#x27;t want to deal with the piracy problem on PC, considering they already deal with it on their relatively locked-down consoles.<p>For better or for worse, Nintendo also likes to really control the experience you get playing games on their platforms; It would probably not be a great look for them to have to deal with thousands of customers that are trying to run their games on hardware older than a Switch and complaining that it&#x27;s a terrible experience. Yeah the existing hardware is underpowered, but its uniformly underpowered, and that&#x27;s worth quite a bit too.<p>I think for Nintendo, the more prudent solution would be to release an updated Switch with some more powerful hardware that&#x27;s fully backwards compatible with the existing Switch library. It would be very par for the course for them, and assuage most of the complaints about the Switch being underpowered.</div><br/><div id="35912840" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35912840" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bzzzt</span><span>|</span><a href="#35912458">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35912493">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35912483">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35912840">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35912840">[16 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">People complaining about the Switch being underpowered are expecting PS5 level performance on a mobile device.

The Wii&#x27;s remote wasn&#x27;t &#x27;underpowered&#x27;, but it was relatively cheap and added an interesting feature.<p>&gt; Why? Will it make the games more fun to play? Does it enable more fun games?<p>These are not the only (though they are important) factors to consider. With a portable platform, battery life, size, weight, heat, all matter much more than with a stationary console. A 2x more powerful Switch with the same power envelope as the original would be able to play games for longer using the same battery due to being more efficient. If you&#x27;re playing a significantly demanding game, that might mean the difference between only being able to do short sessions on battery, and being able to play for a satisfying amount of time. Or it might mean that you can play it with the screen at a higher brightness, and thus make the game accessible in more environments.<p>And if the games are have performance issues, having more powerful hardware can make those problems less frequent and more bearable. You can argue that gamedevs need to do a better job, but that doesn&#x27;t eliminate reality where most people just want to play the game and don&#x27;t particularly care about the specifics of how to get the best experience.</div><br/><div id="35913558" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35913558" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">aikinai</span><span>|</span><a href="#35912458">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35913435">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35913650">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35913558">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35913558">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Nintendo calls it “Lateral Thinking with Withered Technology”[0]<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gunpei_Yokoi#Lateral_Thinking_with_Withered_Technology" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gunpei_Yokoi#Lateral_Thinking_...</a></div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="35913650" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35913650" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">zirgs</span><span>|</span><a href="#35912458">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35913335">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35913435">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35913421">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35913650">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35913650">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Yes, a game that runs smoothly is more fun to play.</div><br/></div></div><div id="35913421" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35913421" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">doix</span><span>|</span><a href="#35912458">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35913335">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35913650">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35913412">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35913421">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35913421">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">A lot of games get limited to 30 fps (and even dip lower) on the switch which makes them unplayable for me.

Taking two unity exemple you can compare :<p>- &#x27;chop chop&#x27; a game using a similar rendering style : <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=GGTTHOpUQDE">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=GGTTHOpUQDE</a>, if you take the pig and its environment showed in the video and go in the github repository you can see they only use one texture map : an albedo one.
All the models (pig + environment) weight about 6mB of textures and 350kB of models. and are sufficient to have the full main character and an environment.<p>- a &#x27;realistic PBR workflow gun asset&#x27; on asset store (choose randomly but seems nice, realistic and containing only the gun so we can see download size) : <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assetstore.unity.com&#x2F;packages&#x2F;3d&#x2F;props&#x2F;guns&#x2F;free-fps-weapon-akm-180663#content" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assetstore.unity.com&#x2F;packages&#x2F;3d&#x2F;props&#x2F;guns&#x2F;free-fps...</a>.

The cellshaded characters are fluid and pretty but the &#x27;low resolution texture and low poly models&#x27; bother me a bit especially on environments.

For me it’s a solid 8&#x2F;10 game but definitely not all that incredible. Some of the mechanics are frustrating like the breaking weapons as you mentioned. I found the open world lacking in life. You can explore, sure, but there’s not much to do.<p>Vast parts of it are just empty stretches with enemies here and there and nothing really happens in that world.<p>I think both are excellent games but neither of them made me want to immerse myself in the worlds they were set in and neither made me want to come back for more.</div><br/></div></div><div id="35913401" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35913401" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">carlosrdrz</span><span>|</span><a href="#35913344">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35913488">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35913470">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35913401">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35913401">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I&#x27;ve played both, and liked BOTW much more, although I also liked Horizon Zero Dawn.

I guess they&#x27;re two very different games. Even though both are &quot;open world&quot;, I feel Zero Dawn is much more &quot;on rails&quot; than BOTW.

I&#x27;m still bitter I bought a 3ds specifically in anticipation of the third game and it was then cancelled.</div><br/><div id="35912835" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35912835" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">manojlds</span><span>|</span><a href="#35912516">root</a><span>|</span><a href="#35912749">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35913071">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35912835">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35912835">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Try Links Awakening</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="35913071" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35913071" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">nly</span><span>|</span><a href="#35912516">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35912749">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35912660">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35913071">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35913071">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Try riding a bear or a stag instead of a horse to mix it up a little.</div><br/></div></div><div id="35912660" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-35912660" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">illwrks</span><span>|</span><a href="#35912516">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#35913071">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#35913398">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-35912660">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-35912660">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Same, I&#x27;ve been playing it for about 4 years.

But I&#x27;ll admit, I haven&#x27;t played many previous Zelda games.<p>Also, the bike is only unlocked after all the divine beasts, when the game is already &quot;over&quot; and you&#x27;re just trying to complete all the shrines and quests.
