Well, it depends.<p>Some apps&#x2F;sites just send you a password reset email. Apps&#x2F;sites like those would reset your passkey the same way: they&#x27;d send you a passkey reset email, you&#x27;d click the link in the email, and they&#x27;d let you regenerate your passkey then and there.<p>Some apps&#x2F;sites try to do something cleverer, e.g. requiring additional factors to reset (MFA), or appointing a &quot;trusted contact&quot; user who can confirm your password reset, or asking &quot;security questions&quot; that only you know the answer to. Those apps&#x2F;sites would put you through the same process to reset your passkey.<p>&quot;How do I reset my password when I forget it&quot; is an infamous balancing act between user friendliness and strict security. The &quot;reset my passkey&quot; problem is exactly as hard, no easier and no harder, as the &quot;reset my password&quot; problem.<p>(Of course, it&#x27;s possible to have a site that has no way to reset your password, and just assumes that you&#x27;ll never forget your password.

A user has different passkeys for different services. The user&#x27;s operating systems, or software similar to today&#x27;s password managers, provide user-friendly management of passkeys. From the user&#x27;s point of view, using passkeys is very similar to using saved passwords, but with significantly better security.<p>[...]<p>&gt; In some cases, for example, when the older device was lost or damaged, users may need to recover the end-to-end encryption keys from a secure online backup.<p>&gt; To recover the end-to-end encryption key, the user must provide the lock screen PIN, password, or pattern of another existing device that had access to those keys. Note, that restoring passkeys on a new device requires both being signed in to the Google Account and an existing device&#x27;s screen lock.<p>So, if you use Google to store passwords or passkeys, it would be a good idea to save backup codes for your Google account somewhere safe.

- Keys cannot be exfiltrated from the hardware, so even if your password manager is compromised, your key would still protect you
- Duplication protection - synced counters are stored on both the key and the server, so even if somebody does clone your key (very difficult), you&#x27;ll know about it (unlike passwords)<p>Obviously, there are some necessary assumptions made, about security of the passkey implementation, DNS security and so on.<p>&gt;if you are not already doing this, then it requires adaptation

Agreed.

You like to get on the latest security buzzword bandwagon, very nice but this makes me trust you less.<p>Passwords are outdated in the same way key locks ok doors are outdated and all they did is have someone else manage federated authentication.<p>I am so exhausted at screaming into the void over this topic. You all do whatever crap you want just know that whatever you do, if it isn&#x27;t at least 2FA it is as shitty as passwords. New and secure just means threar actors haven&#x27;t adopted to it yet. You know the nice thing about old shitty security? There is decades of work and lessons learned on how to make it work nice.<p>Keep your silverbulletd and reinvented wheels and give me knowledge based factor (password,passphrase,pattern,etc...) and a completley separate NGC like FIDO2 and credential recovery options that don&#x27;t involve email or yet another set of credentials. Now, that hard security implementation will actually keep me secure but these lazy bullshit security anti-patterns force me to depend on some bullshit 3rd party vendor, compromise on my privacy and still have me be one step away from total pwnage.<p>All tailscale has convinced me is that they think passing the buck to someone else or getting in on a hype is in the best interest of their users as opposed to investing in layered and reliable security.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36237258" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36237258" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">LeoPanthera</span><span>|</span><a href="#36237624">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36237917">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36237258">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36237258">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; &quot;as well as 1Password&quot;<p>1Password does not support PassKeys.<p>They have announced the intention to, but outside of beta releases it&#x27;s not there yet.</div><br/></div></div><div id="36237917" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-36237917" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gigatexal</span><span>|</span><a href="#36237258">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#36237014">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-36237917">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-36237917">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Are people still happy about Tailscale being a user land version of wireguard?
