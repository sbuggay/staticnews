When dealing with two-way doors it&#x27;s fine and desirable to iterate quickly.<p>&gt; When a decision has to be made, &quot;disagree but commit&quot;. After a discussion takes place, even if you disagree with some aspect, you eventually commit to supporting whatever plan has been made.<p>&gt; Another key take away was that previous generations need to set up the infrastructure that makes it possible for the next generation to innovate. Jeff talks about how Amazon wouldn&#x27;t have been possible without existing mailing infrastructure and the Internet.

Most decisions I&#x27;ve seen given fall in the grey space. Invariably deciding whether a problem was a 2 or 1 way door was politicized. Managers always argued for tech tech debt &quot;because we could walk it back later so it&#x27;s a 2-way door&quot;. Of course when such decisions backfired, it was always the engineer that &quot;didn&#x27;t Have Backbone&quot; or &quot;failed To Be Right A Lot&quot;, with leadership concluding that was a 1-way door and now everyone just had to &quot;Disagree And Commit&quot; instead of paying back the debt.<p>Over my 9 years there, I saw every LP used towards politics or malicious compliance.

That is, if there&#x27;s resistance to open and honest meetings within your teams, most probably it&#x27;s because historically open and honest has not been a safe bet within that organization.<p>I&#x27;ve worked in many companies&#x2F;teams that gave lip service to the truth and open&#x2F;honest discussions, but it usually only took a few times ignoring these principles to kill any trust in the idea. Rebuilding that trust takes time and usually starts small -- it requires demonstrations that persons with power in the company will do their best to protect against repercussions for objective, good faith open reporting (the truth). This will take awhile from my experience, and in many cases there is a need to define &#x27;good faith&#x27; a bit more, else truth sessions typically end up as emotionally charged finger pointing sessions.<p>It&#x27;s possible to do all of this, and not even hard, it just means that those who are asked to lead will need likely need to deal with some emotionally charged arguments for a time if&#x2F;when someone uses the same policy for emotional venting. Nothing wrong with a bit of venting, leaders should be able to handle this gracefully also, but my experience is a lot of leaders are not trained or prepared on how to handle such situations, and the tendency is to rely on the authority of their title rather than address the concerns directly.<p>Basically, there isn&#x27;t much to it, it&#x27;s just a rather awkward path that is best started in smaller groups, establish clear and unambiguous boundaries [0] for such a culture, and provide new reasons for people to trust in _this_ system which has likely failed them historically.<p>0 - I wouldn&#x27;t read too much into what the boundaries should be, it&#x27;s something that is dependent on the people you work with. For a team I was asked to lead, it was set early on that openness and objective discussion were essential -- if a project or situation turned sour, it was established that the important thing was to know and understand why it happened, not to punish, and that meant giving freedom to the team to make mistakes and that while we would review and correct mistakes, the team would also be protected from those &quot;out for blood&quot; over the mistake. It was probably 2 years of ugly arguments with other teams who wanted a scapegoat, but the end result was the team I was asked to lead grew very fast professionally and we got very good at self-correcting and owning mistakes when they happened. Boundaries for the team were that &quot;sometimes&quot; there are going to issues we must handle with a few &quot;we really must avoid messing up here&quot; clauses included -- being extremely judicious with the use of such clauses and ensuring they were truly the exception and not the standard helped retain the sense of importance for such clauses while maintaining the team&#x27;s freedom to handle projects in the &quot;best&quot; way.</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="38714829" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38714829" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mattigames</span><span>|</span><a href="#38712933">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#38714786">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38714829">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38714829">[2 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Few people benefit has much of increasing poverty than Bezos, as more people desire what he hoarded more than anyone else: money, in other words supply and demand of money itself, I wish it was illegal to have more than a billion dollars, that you had to donate anything beyond that.</div><br/><div id="38714965" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-38714965" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">malfist</span><span>|</span><a href="#38714829">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#38714786">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-38714965">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-38714965">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Here there be dragons</div><br/></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
