In particular, it focuses on physical manufacturing.<p>It&#x27;s in the form of a fictitious personal tale. A plant manager struggles to save his plant from closure, and his marriage from falling apart.<p>The lesson is about lean management.<p>My main takeaway is the realization that when we try to optimize something, we focus on how to do something more efficiently. What more often is a problem is that people and processes are blocked from doing work. They spend a lot of time waiting and doing nothing. Focusing on reducing waits will produce better results than focusing on doing the work faster. Of course reducing the waits might mean doing some targeted piece of work faster. It could also mean doing better scheduling or focusing on other resource contention.<p>Recently I used this mindset to optimize a legacy DB struggling under the weight of a hodgepodge of unmaintained code. It worked wonderfully. Instead of fixing the slowest queries, focused on fixing the ones that block the most often. The result was that the DB <i>was</i> able to handle the workload after all.</div><br/><div id="37158971" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37158971" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gjadi</span><span>|</span><a href="#37157356">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37158459">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37158971">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37158971">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For those interested on this topic but would like a lighter approach, there is now a graphic novel: The Goal A Business Graphic Novel.</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37158459" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37158459" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">bambax</span><span>|</span><a href="#37157356">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37157115">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37158459">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37158459">[3 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The Dawn of Everything, by Graeber and Wengrow.<p>Refutes most of the claims made by Harari in Sapiens, and shows everything you though you knew about prehistory is plain wrong.

I&#x27;m not sure what possessed me to read these books but I was curious about both industries since they are significant parts of the economy but I knew next to nothing about them.<p>The banking book is called &quot;The Most Fun I Never Want To Have Again: A Mid-Life Crisis in Community Banking&quot;[0] and it tells the story of an attempted bank startup in Georgia just before the financial crisis. It has a very clear explanation of the bank business model and how small banks make money. One of the surprising things I took away from it is that bank founders think of starting a bank in ways that are very similar to how tech founders think of starting of company. The main difference is that the bank business model is already well understood to those in the industry and success depends much more on your positioning in the market than it does on innovation.<p>The insurance book is called &quot;Risk &amp; Reward: An Inside View of the Property&#x2F;Casualty Insurance Business&quot;[1] and is by Stephen Catlin, who founded an insurance company that he grew to several thousand employees with offices around the world and later sold for $4 billion. Very UK centered since that&#x27;s mostly where his career took place but I don&#x27;t think the fundamentals of the industry change that much around the world. Pretty detailed on the mechanics of how insurance underwriting works and what insurance underwriters think about when pricing risk. Made me realize insurance is much more like trading than I&#x27;d previously thought.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;product&#x2F;B00ELPOA3S&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;product&#x2F;B00ELPOA3S&#x2F;</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;product&#x2F;B073NRDNSC&#x2F;" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;product&#x2F;B073NRDNSC&#x2F;</a></div><br/><div id="37157971" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37157971" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">mrcode007</span><span>|</span><a href="#37157115">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37158749">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37157971">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37157971">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">Thanks for the review and the links !</div><br/></div></div></div></div><div id="37158749" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37158749" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">rwoerz</span><span>|</span><a href="#37157115">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37157571">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37158749">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37158749">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">I stumbled upon Leonard Susskinds physics lectures on YouTube and bought the accompanying books [1].

The thesis is that the Christian Church inadvertently created modern society by prohibiting polygamy and cousin marriage.<p>The topic of polygamy is what’s really stuck in my head. Polygamy is a more natural state for civilized human societies than we think it is. It may be to women’s advantage to choose an “elite” spouse she has to share because it could mean a better quality of life for her and her children than the alternatives. Chris Hemsworth could have two dozen wives if it were legal and social acceptable (and he wanted to), and his wives might be happy with that. But the downside (or one of them) is that it creates huge imbalances in society—men find it really hard to find a mate. They then do risky stuff to make it into the elite to try to attract a mate—steal to accumulate wealth or kill potential romantic rivals.<p>This isn’t in the book, but it made me think—are we back in that same position now? Polygamy isn’t *technically* legal or common, but you still have plenty of people who have many romantic partners—just not at the same time. We know the what the activity of dating apps looks like—a very small subset of “elite” men get an outsized proportion of likes and matches from women. It’s slim pickings for the rest of the men. Are men, unable to find a mate, going to resort to risky behavior to try to make it into that subset that are able to attract women?</div><br/><div id="37158992" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37158992" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">gjadi</span><span>|</span><a href="#37157571">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37158976">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37158992">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37158992">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">For a longer review of the book, I liked <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;astralcodexten.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;your-book-review-the-weirdest-people" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;astralcodexten.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;your-book-review-the-w...</a> (disclaimer: I haven&#x27;t read the book itself).</div><br/></div></div><div id="37158976" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37158976" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">benterix</span><span>|</span><a href="#37157571">parent</a><span>|</span><a href="#37158992">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37157907">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37158976">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37158976">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">&gt; his wives might be happy with that.<p>Maybe, maybe not.

The move from middle to high income requires a educated workforce. If you don&#x27;t have enough educated workers across the board you fall into the middle income trap where you have large structural unemployment and get high crime. This happened to Mexico and Brazil for example. China&#x27;s rural population struggles with a low education level. The author investigated why. The answers come down to a mix of health issues, lack of education on how to raise babies, dysfunction in the education system and the houku system.<p>Short interesting read for anyone interested in China or development economics. The book does a great job composting to other countries and showing that way how development works and doesn&#x27;t.</div><br/></div></div><div id="37158554" class="c"><input type="checkbox" id="c-37158554" checked=""/><div class="controls bullet"><span class="by">spoiler</span><span>|</span><a href="#37157305">prev</a><span>|</span><a href="#37158066">next</a><span>|</span><label class="collapse" for="c-37158554">[-]</label><label class="expand" for="c-37158554">[1 more]</label></div><br/><div class="children"><div class="content">The Cradle series by Will Wight. It&#x27;s a Wuxia adapted for Western audiences. He has other great series; I liked the parallel Sea&#x2F;Shadow trilogies a lot. Traveler&#x27;s Gate series I enjoyed, but not as much as the rest. He recently also started a new series called Last Horizon; it&#x27;s about space wizards and it&#x27;s a bit whimsical, but fun.<p>The Expanse series is great, but I reckon people already mentioned it elsewhere in the thread.<p>James Islington&#x27;s Licanius trilogy is one of my favourite fantasy book series probably. He recently started a new series called Hierarchy, which I also recommend. They&#x27;re very &quot;grounded&quot; fantasy, and the magic systems is very woven into society and its structure.
